## Welcome!

Thanks for visiting the Speckle user guide — your go-to resource for everything you need to know about the platform.

Teams around the world use Speckle to collaborate, share data, and automate their workflows, helping them deliver better buildings, faster.  

While we’ll walk you through the most common ways to use Speckle, the platform is flexible and can adapt to your specific needs.

Let’s get started!

## Speckle

Speckle is made up of several key components that work together to help you manage, share, and view your data. Before we dive into the details, here’s a quick overview:

### Speckle Web App

The **Speckle Web App** lets you manage your data directly from your web browser.
It includes tools for organising projects, managing collaborators, and viewing 3D models — all in one place.

### Speckle Connectors

**Connectors** are plugins for popular design and construction tools like Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, AutoCAD, SketchUp, Civil 3D, Blender, and more.
They handle sending and receiving data between your software and your Speckle account.

Connectors can work with almost any kind of data, especially CAD and BIM models — including geometry and metadata.
When you send data from your software to Speckle, the connector automatically converts it into Speckle’s neutral format.
This makes it easy to open, view, or use your data in other tools — without any extra setup.
