<Accordion title="Why is the Speckle plugin not showing up after I installed the connector?">
Make sure your version of {app} is one of the supported versions. Installation issues are also sometimes caused by conflicting plugins. Please report your problem in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help

And include the following information:

- Your application version
- Your Speckle connector version
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What should I do if the plugin UI is empty or unresponsive, or if my application crashes?">
If your connector window is floating, **try docking it to your application** to fix blank UI issues.
For major issues, you can sometimes find a `log` file in your directory at `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`. 
Please report your problem in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help and include the following information:

- Your application version
- Your Speckle connector version
- A copy of the log

<Accordion title="How do I uninstall my connector?">
All Speckle connectors are installed like any other program. You can uninstall them directly from your system's `Applications`. For a full uninstall, you should also remove `Speckle Desktop Services` as well as your Speckle connector.

<Accordion title="How do I update my connector to the latest version?">
You can always download the latest version of the connector at https://app.speckle.systems/connectors. If a new version of the connector is available, you will also see a notification in your connector UI. [@bilal need autoupdating behavior]
