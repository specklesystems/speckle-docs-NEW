<Accordion title="Why is the Speckle plugin not showing up after I installed the connector?">
    - Make sure your version of {app} is one of the supported versions. 
    - Uninstall and [reinstall your connector](/connectors/installation).
    - Installation issues can also be caused by conflicting plugins.

<Accordion title="What should I do if the plugin UI is empty or unresponsive, or if my application crashes?">
    If your connector window is floating, **try docking it to your application** to fix blank UI issues.
    
    For major issues, you can sometimes find a `log` file in your directory at `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`.
