<Accordion title="Why is the Speckle plugin not showing up after I installed the connector?">
    1. Make sure your version of {app} is one of the supported versions. 
    2. Uninstall and [reinstall your connector](/connectors/installation).
    
    Note: Make sure you are **not** selecting **Run as administrator** when installing - this will install for the administrator user, and not your own user.
    Instead, double-click the `.exe` or right-clicking and then selecting `Open` to run the installer.
    Installation issues can also be caused by conflicting plugins.

    If you're still experiencing problems, please report it in our [Community Forum](https://speckle.community/c/help) and include the following information:

<Accordion title="What should I do if the plugin UI is empty or unresponsive, or if my application crashes?">
    If your connector window is floating, **try docking it to your application** to fix blank UI issues.
    
    For major issues, you can sometimes find a `log` file in your directory at `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`. 
    Please report your problem in our [Community Forum](https://speckle.community/c/help) and include the following information:

    - A copy of the log

<Accordion title="Why can't I add a new account?">
    This can happen if our **desktop service** isn't running. Desktop Service is used for authenticating new accounts. If it's not running, search for **Speckle Desktop Services** in Windows search and run it.

<Accordion title="How do I uninstall my connector?">
    All Speckle connectors are installed like any other program. You can uninstall them directly from your system's `Applications`. For a full uninstall, you should also remove **Speckle Desktop Services** as well as your Speckle connector.

<Accordion title="How do I update my connector to the latest version?">
    You can always download the latest version of the connector [in the web app](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors).
    If a new version of the connector is available, you will also see a notification in your connector UI.
