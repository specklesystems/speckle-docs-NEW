  <Accordion title="Do Next-Gen connectors and legacy connectors support the same tools?">
    They match, but not completely.

    Next-Gen connectors are available for: Revit, Rhino, Archicad, AutoCAD, Navisworks, SketchUp, Blender, Civil 3D, Grasshopper, ETABS, Tekla, and Power BI. These connectors are available in the legacy version as well, but we recommend you to use the Next-Gen version.

    These connectors will be available only in the legacy version: Dynamo, Unity, Unreal, Excel, SAP2000, SAFE, CSiBridge, Bentley (MicroStation, OpenRoads, OpenRail, OpenBuilding), Advance Steel, TopSolid and QGIS.

  <Accordion title="Can I still use legacy connectors?">
    If you need to use legacy connectors, they will still be available for download here.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I update the Next-gen connectors without Speckle Manager?">
    If a new version of Next-Gen connectors is available, you'll see a little Update button when you open it up in your host application. You can always go back to app.speckle.systems, to check for the latest version.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's happening to Speckle Manager?">
    Speckle Manager is only used to install legacy connectors. If you must continue using legacy connectors, the Manager will be available here!
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I uninstall the Next-Gen connectors?">
    Just head to your computer's standard programs/applications list and uninstall like any other app.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I remove an account or change the default one without Speckle Manager?">
    Accounts can be removed or changed even without Speckle Manager. Whichever account you had selected last time (across devices) is your default for the next session.

    1. Click your profile picture at the top open up your account manager.

    2. Click to Switch your active account. Your last used account will be the default account.

    3. You can add a new account, or click on the Trash icon on any current account to remove it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to upgrade immediately?">
    No, but v2 connectors are no longer supported or receiving updates. Switching to next-gen connectors ensures better performance and future-proofed workflows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will my old v2 data disappear?">
    No. v2 streams remain in read-only mode in your personal area. You can still view or download them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I roll back to v2?">
    No; v2 and v3 connectors are built on different data models and cannot reliably be used interchangeably.
