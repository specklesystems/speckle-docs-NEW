  <Accordion title="In the project page, the Move button is disabled. Why?">
    The **Move** button is disabled if you are not the project owner. Only the
    project owner can initiate the move to a workspace. If you need to migrate a
    personal project, contact the project owner to perform the migration.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens to my collaborators when i migrate?">
    If you have collaborators on a personal project, they will still have access
    to the project in read-only mode. However, they will not be able to send new
    data to the personal project. You can change their role to **Editor** in the
    migrated project. Depending on the workspace plan they will affect your
    billing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I cant move my project because my workspace is at its limit.">
    If your workspace has reached its project limit or model limit, you can
    either: - Upgrade your workspace plan to increase the project limit. - Add
    the Unlimited Project and Models add-on to your workspace plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will my personal projects disappear?">
    No. Personal projects remain in read-only mode for your reference and
    download.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I automate this migration?">
    Currently, no; personal projects and workspace projects use different
    permissions for collaborators. Migration is a manual process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I have a lot of personal projects?">
    If you have many personal projects, consider prioritizing the most important
    ones for migration. You can also use the search functionality in the project
    page to quickly find and move specific projects. There is no bulk migration
    feature at this time, so each project must be moved individually.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I still access my personal projects if I don't migrate?">
    Yes, you can still access your personal projects in read-only mode. They
    will remain available for reference and download, but you cannot send new
    data to them.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Where is the `main` model?">
    The `main` model was the default model in the v2 connectors. There is no longer an enforced convention for the `main` model.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I can't make a `main` model in the web application.">
    The `main` model was the default model in the v2 connectors. There is no longer an enforced convention for the `main` model, but for backward compatibility it is a reserved model name.
