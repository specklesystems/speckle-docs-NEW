  <Accordion title="Can legacy and Next-Gen connectors work together?">
    No. Next-Gen is a clean-slate rebuild—faster, smarter, and more reliable.

    Models made with legacy connectors may not display correctly in Next-Gen.

    For best results:

    🔁 Re-publish models using a Next-Gen connector.

    🔁 Don't mix connector generations in collaborative workflows.
