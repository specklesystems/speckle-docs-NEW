    You can invite someone to your workspace by clicking the **Invite** button in the top right corner of the workspace page.
  
    You can also set your workspace to allow self-signup by making your workspace **domain discoverable**.
    User with a email domain matching what you have verified to the workspace will be notified your 
    workspace exists and can request to join, and you'll accept the request or you can set it up to 
    automatically add them to the workspace.

    <Warning>
      Automatic joining is only available for *enterprise* plans else you would be at 
      risk of an uncontrolled escalation of your billing.
    </Warning>

    <Note>
      Only admins can invite users to a workspace.
