  <Accordion title="How do I restore a version?">
    You can't promote a specific version to be the latest, but you can publish a new version 
    which will become the latest. Or delete all newer versions. Receiving a specific 
    version and re-publishing it will theoretically restore it, but this can be a lossy 
    process depending on the connector. More reliable would be to do so programmatically.
