  <Accordion title="Can I choose who can edit specific models?">
    No, edit rights are set at the project level only at this time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I set a model as read-only?">
    No, read-only status is set at the project level only at this time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why use multiple models?">
    Here are a few common reasons:
    - **Split by discipline**: For large projects, separate models by team, e.g., <em>Architecture</em>, <em>Structural</em>, and <em>MEP</em>. This ensures each team receives only what’s relevant.    
    - **Split by building**: If your project includes multiple buildings, keep them in one project but create separate models like <em>Building A</em>, <em>Building B</em>, and <em>Building C</em>.
    - **Explore design options**: Want to present different façade concepts? Create models like <em>Option A</em>, <em>Option B</em>, and <em>Option C</em> and switch between them to show your client.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'federating models' mean?">
    In Speckle, you can <strong>federate models</strong> by loading multiple models into the same view — even if created separately.
    This is useful for working with different teams or disciplines. For example, view the <em>architecture</em>, <em>structure</em>, and <em>MEP</em> models together in a single, coordinated view without merging them into one file.
       
    Federating models helps you:
    - Compare design options
    - Coordinate between disciplines
    - Keep models separate while viewing them side by side
   You can do this directly in the <strong>Speckle 3D viewer</strong> or in supported 
   design tools using our **connectors**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I create and manage models?">
    You can create as many models as needed within a project. The Speckle Web App makes it simple to:
    - Add new models
    - Rename models
    - Switch between models
    This helps you keep your work organised and ensures each model is used as intended.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I delete a model?">
    You can delete a model by selecting the **Delete model** button in the model settings drop-down found on the models list page.
     This will remove the model from the project and **all associated data**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many models can I have in a project?">
    You can have as many models as you need in a project. However, the number of models you have in total in your workspace 
    across all projects may be limited by your workspace plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I switch between models?">
    You can switch between models by selecting the model from the models list page.
     This will open the model in the Speckle Web Viewer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I rename a model?">
    Yes, you can rename a model by selecting the model from the models list page and clicking the **Rename model** button.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I move a model to another folder?">
    You can move a model to another folder by selecting the model from the models list 
    page and clicking the **Rename model** button.
    It is the presence of `/`s in the model name that determines the folder structure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many folders can I have?">
    You can have as many folders as you need in a project. It is the presence of `/`s in the 
    model name that determines the folder structure. However, it may be preferable to only use 
    one or two levels of folders to keep your models organised.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is there a maximum size for a model?">
    Theoretically no, but the performance of the 3D viewer will be impacted if it is large number of 
    extremelly detailed objects. It can be benefical to break models up and federate them together
    as required to keep the performance high.
