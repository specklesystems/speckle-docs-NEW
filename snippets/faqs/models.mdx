  <Accordion title="Why use multiple models?">
    <p>Here are a few common reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Split by discipline:</strong> For large projects, separate models by team, e.g., <em>Architecture</em>, <em>Structural</em>, and <em>MEP</em>. This ensures each team receives only what’s relevant.</li>
      <li><strong>Split by building:</strong> If your project includes multiple buildings, keep them in one project but create separate models like <em>Building A</em>, <em>Building B</em>, and <em>Building C</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Explore design options:</strong> Want to present different façade concepts? Create models like <em>Option A</em>, <em>Option B</em>, and <em>Option C</em> and switch between them to show your client.</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does 'federating models' mean?">
    In Speckle, you can <strong>federate models</strong> by loading multiple models into the same view — even if created separately.
    This is useful for working with different teams or disciplines. For example, view the <em>architecture</em>, <em>structure</em>, and <em>MEP</em> models together in a single, coordinated view without merging them into one file.
       
    Federating models helps you:
    - Compare design options
    - Coordinate between disciplines
    - Keep models separate while viewing them side by side
   You can do this directly in the <strong>Speckle 3D viewer</strong> or in supported 
   design tools using our **connectors**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I create and manage models?">
    You can create as many models as needed within a project. The Speckle Web App makes it simple to:
    - Add new models
    - Rename models
    - Switch between models
    This helps you keep your work organised and ensures each model is used as intended.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I delete a model?">
    You can delete a model by selecting the **Delete model** button in the model settings drop-down found on the models list page.
     This will remove the model from the project and **all associated data**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many models can I have in a project?">
    You can have as many models as you need in a project. However, the number of models you have in total in your workspace 
    across all projects may be limited by your workspace plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I switch between models?">
    You can switch between models by selecting the model from the models list page.
     This will open the model in the Speckle Web Viewer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I rename a model?">
    Yes, you can rename a model by selecting the model from the models list page and clicking the **Rename model** button.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I move a model to another folder?">
    You can move a model to another folder by selecting the model from the models list 
    page and clicking the **Rename model** button.
    It is the presence of `/`s in the model name that determines the folder structure.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many folders can I have?">
    You can have as many folders as you need in a project. It is the presence of `/`s in the 
    model name that determines the folder structure. However, it may be preferable to only use 
    one or two levels of folders to keep your models organised.
