  <Accordion title="Tips for exporting very large models">
    Exporting large Navisworks models to Speckle can require substantial time and memory, depending on your model's size and your computer's capabilities. To improve performance and reduce the chance of issues:

      - <strong>Export in smaller parts:</strong> Use selection sets or split your model to send only the necessary elements.
      - <strong>Optimize system resources:</strong> Close other applications to maximize available memory before publishing.
      - <strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> If you experience problems, try exporting smaller sections or reach out to the <a href="https://speckle.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speckle community</a> for assistance.
