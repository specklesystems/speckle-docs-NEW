Our powerful SDKs have been updated to support the next gen connectors and 
data models. We will be bringing back some of your favourite examples and guides.

Example use-cases for developing with Speckle:

- Building your own applications or integrations.
- Automating tasks.
- Custom web apps and visualisations.
- Data pipelining and ETL.
- Robotics and 3D printing.
- Data analysis and machine learning.

In the meantime, you can find our older docs including the viewer API, server deployment and legacy SDKs in the [Developer Hub](https://speckle.guide/dev/).

import LinkHeader from '/snippets/links/headers.mdx';

These are current and valid today and waiting for migration. Use them to build your own applications or implement Speckle in your own platform.

Learn how to deploy your own Speckle server using the open-source Speckle Server via Docker or Kubernetes.
