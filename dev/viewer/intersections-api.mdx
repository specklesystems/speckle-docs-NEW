title: Intersections
description: Entry point for intersecting and obtaining intersection data from the scene. Accessible from [_SpeckleRenderer_](/dev/viewer/speckle-renderer-api)

## Methods

### intersect

```typescript
intersect(
    scene: Scene,
    camera: Camera,
    point: Vector2,
    castLayers: ObjectLayers.STREAM_CONTENT_MESH,
    nearest?: boolean,
    bounds?: Box3,
    firstOnly?: boolean,
    tasOnly?: boolean
  ): Array<ExtendedMeshIntersection> | null

intersect(
    scene: Scene,
    camera: Camera,
    point: Vector2,
    castLayers?: Array<ObjectLayers>,
    nearest?: boolean,
    bounds?: Box3,
    firstOnly?: boolean,
    tasOnly?: boolean
  ): Array<ExtendedIntersection> | null
```

Scene intersect function.
<Tip>
All intersect calls from this class will use the available acceleration structures. This makes the intersection **significantly** faster than using your own three.js raycasters.
</Tip>

**Parameters**

- **scene**: [_Scene_](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=scene#api/en/scenes/Scene)
- **camera**: [_Camera_](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/Camera)
- **point**: The NDC point to cast the ray from
- **castLayers**: The [_ObjectLayers_](/viewer/viewer-api.md#objectlayers) enabled on the raycaster 
- **nearest**: If the results should be sorted by dinstance. i.e nearest first
- **bounds**: An optional bounds where the intersecting takes place. Everything outside this bounds is disregarded from the result list
for this cast. Any object outside of these layers is disregarded from intersection
- **firstOnly**: When this flag is enabled the acceleration structure will stop traversing after encountering the first intersection. Only applies to meshes
- **tasOnly**: When this flag is enabled, onyl the TAS will be intersected. Can be combined with `firstOnly` if wanted
**Returns**: Array< Intersection > Three.js defined intersection

### intersectRay

```typescript
intersectRay(
    scene: Scene,
    camera: Camera,
    ray: Ray,
    castLayers: ObjectLayers.STREAM_CONTENT_MESH,
    nearest?: boolean,
    bounds?: Box3,
    firstOnly?: boolean,
    tasOnly?: boolean
  ): Array<ExtendedMeshIntersection> | null
intersectRay(
    scene: Scene,
    camera: Camera,
    ray: Ray,
    castLayers?: Array<ObjectLayers>,
    nearest?: boolean,
    bounds?: Box3,
    firstOnly?: boolean,
    tasOnly?: boolean
  ): Array<ExtendedIntersection> | null
```

Scene intersect function using a provided Ray.
<Tip>
All intersect calls from this class will use the available acceleration structures. This makes the intersection **significantly** faster than using your own three.js raycasters.

**Parameters**

- **scene**: [_Scene_](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=scene#api/en/scenes/Scene)
- **camera**: [_Camera_](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=camera#api/en/cameras/Camera)
- **ray**: The ray to use for casting
- **castLayers**: The [_ObjectLayers_](/viewer/viewer-api.md#objectlayers) enabled on the raycaster 
- **nearest**: If the results should be sorted by dinstance. i.e nearest first
- **bounds**: An optional bounds where the intersecting takes place. Everything outside this bounds is disregarded from the result list
for this cast. Any object outside of these layers is disregarded from intersection
- **firstOnly**: When this flag is enabled the acceleration structure will stop traversing after encountering the first intersection. Only applies to meshes
- **tasOnly**: When this flag is enabled, onyl the TAS will be intersected. Can be combined with `firstOnly` if wanted
**Returns**: Array< Intersection > Three.js defined intersection

## Typedefs

### ExtendedIntersection

```typescript
interface ExtendedIntersection extends Intersection {
  batchObject?: BatchObject;
  pointOnLine?: Material;
}
```

Extension of three.js's default Intersection.

### ExtendedMeshIntersection

```typescript
interface ExtendedMeshIntersection extends MeshIntersection {
  batchObject: BatchObject
  object: SpeckleMesh | SpeckleInstancedMesh
}
```

### MeshIntersection

```typescript
interface MeshIntersection extends Intersection {
  face: Face
  faceIndex: number
}
```
