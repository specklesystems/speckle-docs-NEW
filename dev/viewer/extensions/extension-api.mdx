description: Base class for all extensions. Extensions are created via [_createExtension_](/dev/viewer/viewer-api#createextension) method from the viewer instance.

## Properties

### viewer

```typescript
protected viewer: IViewer
```

All extensions hold a reference to the viewer implementation instance that spawned them

## Accessors

### enabled

```typescript
get enabled(): boolean
set enabled(value: boolean)
```

All extensions should implement enabling/disabling themselves

### inject

```typescript
get inject(): Array<Constructor<Extension>>
```
