## Share using URL link
With Speckle, sharing your 3D models is as easy as copying a link or embedding an interactive viewer—no huge file transfers required. Because Speckle is a web app, you can access and interact with your models from any device—desktop, tablet, or phone—from anywhere with an internet connection. **No special software or licenses are required to view and interact with models;** everything runs right in your browser:

You have two simple ways to share your Speckle model:

1. **Copy and paste the URL**  
Just grab the link from your browser’s address bar and send it to anyone who needs access.

2. **Use the Share button**  
Click Share in the top-right corner, then select Copy link. Paste that link wherever you like.

<Warning>
If someone can’t open your link, check your project’s permissions. You may need to give them access to your workspace or project first. For details, see [Managing Access and Permissions](/workspace-setup/workspaces#managing-access-and-permissions) guide.
</Warning>
