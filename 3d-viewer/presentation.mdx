## View Modes
Use view modes to find the perfect visual setup for presenting, reviewing, or working on your model.

<Frame caption="The different appearance of the available view modes">

</Frame>

### View Mode Settings
Speckle's view modes let you switch visual styles and tweak display settings to suit your needs:

- **Pick a style.** Pick from Pen, Arctic, Shaded and more styles.
- **Edge toggle.** Turn edge lines on or off to highlight or simplify your view.
- **Line thickness.** Easily make lines thicker or thinner for clearer outlines and emphasis.
- **Change color.** Change the color of the model outlines to match your presentation or for clarity.

</Frame>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I set a default view mode?">
No, the view mode is set on a view by view basis at view time. You can lock in a view mode by creating a comment and all viewer settings are locked in if you review that comment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I set the edges to always be off?">
No, edges start on by default.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I set the line thickness to always be a certain value related to the model scale?">
No, the line thickness is a setting relative the view. As you zoom in and out the line thickness will maintain a consistent size.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="I have a very detailed model, will the edges be visible?">
There is some clever rendering going on to ensure that edges are visible even on very detailed models without becoming too busy.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Section
The Section box lets you carve out a 3D region in your model to reveal and inspect its interior geometry. 
Simply position and resize the box to slice through walls, floors, or any elements, exposing hidden details for 
review or presentation without permanently altering your model.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/3d-viewer/section.jpg" />
</Frame>

The section tool can be used to create unique views of the model for presentations or design review. You can control:
- **Position**: Use the translation gizmo at the center of the section box to move in the direction of each axis.
- **Rotation**: Use the rotation gizmo at the center of the section box to rotate in the direction of each axis.
- **Size**: Select a virtual face of the section box and then use the translation gizmo at the center of the face to move 
it in the perpendicular direction.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I set a default section?">
No, the section tool defaults to a 3D region encompassing the bounding box of the model or selected elements. You can lock in a section by creating a comment and all viewer settings are locked in if you review that comment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I set individual section planes?">
No, the section tool defaults to a single cuboid region encompassing the bounding box of the model or selected elements.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I set multiple section boxes?">
No, the section tool defaults to a single cuboid region encompassing the bounding box of the model or selected elements.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Lighting Controls
Use Light Controls to make sure every part of your model is clearly visible, whether you're inspecting fine details or presenting to stakeholders.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Light Controls Settings
Speckle's lighting controls let you tweak how your model is lit to improve visibility and contrast:

- **Intensity.** Increase or decrease overall brightness to suit your environment.

- **Elevation.** Adjust the vertical angle of the light source to highlight different surfaces.

- **Azimuth.** Change the horizontal rotation of the light to control shadow direction.

- **Indirect.** Modify the amount of ambient or bounced light for softer, more realistic shading.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I set a default light control?">
No, the light control is set on a view by view basis at view time. You can lock in a light control by creating a comment and all viewer settings are locked in if you review that comment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I set the lighting to be a real time of day?">
No, the lighting is quasi-real-world relative to model space.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I specify a location in the world for the lighting?">
No, the lighting is relative to the model space and doesn't have a world location.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I export the shadows?">
No, the shadows are only visible in the viewer.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Explode
The Explode tool breaks your model into its individual components, spreading them apart in the 3D space. This works best for small details or products to understand how they come together.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/3d-viewer/explode.jpg" />
</Frame>

<Note>The elements that are exploding are determined by the source data from the host application. 
i.e. If an element is aggregated as a composite in one object, it may not explode into its components.</Note>

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I constrain the explode to a single axis?">
No, the explode is radial from the center of the model.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I explode by floor or other model elements?">
No the explode is only available for the model as a whole.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I explode a section?">
Yes, you can explode the model while a section is active.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Why do some parts of the model explode more than others?">
The explode is a radial operation from the center of the model. Elements that are closer to the center of the model explode more than elements that are further away.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Canonical Views
You can set the camera position and view to a canonical view: Top, Front, Left, Right, and Back.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I set a default canonical view?">
No, the canonical view defaults to a perspective top down from left to right. You can lock in a canonical view by creating a comment and all viewer settings are locked in if you review that comment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I set additional canonical views?">
No, the canonical views are predefined. Connectors may publish additional views that will be displayed in the canonical views dropdown.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I add 2d plan or section drawings to include in the view?">
No, the canonical views are 3d views of model data. 2D data may be included in the models sent to Speckle, but not added to the canonical views.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I show the levels/grids of the model in the view?">
No, the canonical views are 3d views of model data. Levels, grids, and other 2d data may be included in the models sent to Speckle, but not added to the canonical views.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Projection
Speckle's Projection settings let you switch between different camera views:

- **Perspective.** A realistic view with vanishing points, perfect for presentations and spatial understanding.

- **Orthographic.** A flat, scale-accurate view without perspective distortion, ideal for precise measurement and technical review.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I set a default projection?">
No, the projection defaults to perspective. You can lock in a projection by creating a comment and all viewer settings are locked in if you review that comment.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I change the FOV of the perspective view?">
No, the fov and aspect ratio are fixed. It is approximately equivalent to a 50mm lens on a full frame camera.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Fit

The Fit tool adjusts the camera to fit the entire model in the view. If an object or objects are selected, the Fit tool will fit the camera to the selected objects.
