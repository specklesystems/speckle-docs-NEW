### View Modes
Speckle’s View Modes let you switch visual styles and tweak display settings to suit your needs:

- **Pick a style.** Pick from Pen, Arctic, Shaded and more styles.

- **Edge toggle.** Turn edge lines on or off to highlight or simplify your view.

- **Line thickness.** Easily make lines thicker or thinner for clearer outlines and emphasis.

Use View Modes to find the perfect visual setup for presenting, reviewing, or working on your model.

### Light Controls
Speckle’s Light Controls let you tweak how your model is lit to improve visibility and contrast:

- **Intensity.** Increase or decrease overall brightness to suit your environment.

- **Elevation.** Adjust the vertical angle of the light source to highlight different surfaces.

- **Azimuth.** Change the horizontal rotation of the light to control shadow direction.

- **Indirect.** Modify the amount of ambient or bounced light for softer, more realistic shading.

Use Light Controls to make sure every part of your model is clearly visible, whether you’re inspecting fine details or presenting to stakeholders.

### Projection
Speckle’s Projection settings let you switch between different camera views:

- **Perspective.** A realistic view with vanishing points, perfect for presentations and spatial understanding.

- **Orthographic.** A flat, scale-accurate view without perspective distortion, ideal for precise measurement and technical review.

### Section
The Section box lets you carve out a 3D region in your model to reveal and inspect its interior geometry. Simply position and resize the box to slice through walls, floors, or any elements, exposing hidden details for review or presentation without permanently altering your model.

### Explode
The Explode Model tool breaks your model into its individual components, spreading them apart in the 3D space. This works best for small details or products to understand how they come together.
