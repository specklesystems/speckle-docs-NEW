Speckle’s discussions help teams collaborate directly on models without switching tools:

<Tip> **Tip:** Use Speckle’s Discussions to keep all feedback tied to the actual model, reduce email threads, and speed up review cycles.</Tip>

- **Comments & Chat.** Add notes or questions to any object and chat live in the same panel. Attach comments to specific geometry for clear context, see when teammates are typing, and reply instantly.

- **Share comments link.** Generate a link to a comment or thread so teammates jump straight to the discussion in the model.

- **Attaching files.** Drag and drop images, PDFs, or other documents into threads to share references or detailed notes.

- **Saved viewer.** Lock in a specific view and comment layout. Share the exact camera angle, filters, and comments so everyone sees the same snapshot.
