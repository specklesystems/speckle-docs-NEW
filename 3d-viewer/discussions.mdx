Discussions are the threads of comments and replies that are tied to a specific object or model. 
They help teams collaborate directly on models without switching tools.

<Tip> **Tip:** Use Speckle's Discussions to keep all feedback tied to the actual model, reduce email threads, and speed up review cycles.</Tip>

## Communicate with your team
Add notes or questions to any object and chat live in the same panel. Attach comments to specific geometry for clear context, 
see when teammates are typing, and reply instantly.

- **Attach files**: Drag and drop images, PDFs, or other documents into threads to share references or detailed notes.

- **Share a link** Generate a link to a comment or thread so teammates jump straight to the discussion in the model.

<Tip> Lock in a specific view and comment layout. Share the exact camera angle, view mode filters, and section cut so everyone sees the same snapshot.
