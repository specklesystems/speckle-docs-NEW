### Scene Explorer
The Scene Explorer is a panel that lets you navigate your 3D model using a familiar tree view:

1. **Hierarchy view:** See models organized by levels, categories, or custom groups.

2. **Visibility controls:** Show, hide, or isolate individual objects or groups with a single click.

Use the Scene Explorer to focus on the parts of your model you care about, cleanly toggle layers, and understand the structure of complex scenes.

### Filtering
Speckle’s filtering tools let you quickly find, highlight, and analyze parts of your model based on any property or parameter:

Filter and search:

1. Open the filter panel and choose any property from your model (e.g., category, level, tag).

2. Type or select values to narrow down the list of objects.

3. Click the brush icon on the top right corner of the panel to color-code the model.

4. Query specific values. Use the search box to look for a particular value within the filtered property (e.g., all "category" Walls with “FireRating = 2”).

<Tip>**Tip:** First, use a filter in combination with isolate, then apply another filter to explore the model further.</Tip>

### Dev Mode
Dev Mode gives you a deeper look into your model’s data structure:

- **Full hierarchy view.** See every object, list, and parameter exactly as Speckle stores it.

- **Raw JSON inspection.** View and copy the underlying JSON data for any item—perfect for developers or power users.

Use Dev Mode when you need complete transparency or want to integrate Speckle data into your own workflows and applications.

### Measure mode
Speckle’s Measure tool lets you take quick measurements directly in the 3D view:

- **Point-to-point measurement.** Click two points in the model to get the straight-line distance.

- **Perpendicular measurement.** Measure the shortest distance from a point to a line or plane.

- **Units & precision.** Switch between metric and imperial units and adjust decimal precision to suit your needs.

Use the Measure tool to verify dimensions, check clearances, and validate design details without leaving the viewer.
