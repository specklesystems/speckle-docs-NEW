description: "Collaborate efficiently in the 3D Viewer"

Model federation makes it easy for different teams—like architects, structural engineers, and MEP designers—to share and combine their models without sending huge files back and forth.

Speckle lets you combine models created in different software—Revit, Rhino, AutoCAD, and more—without juggling huge files.

How it works:

1. **Publish separately.**
Each team uploads their model straight from the tool they use into a Speckle project (think a project folder that holds all the models).

2. **Assemble on demand.**
In your project, click Add in the left sidebar to bring in other models alongside the one you opened.

3. **Combine everything.**
From the main project view, click View All in 3D. This opens the 3D Viewer and displays every model together in one scene.
