### Selection Info Panel (Right Sidebar)

The Selection Info Panel provides detailed information and controls for interacting with selected objects in the model. It displays key properties and metadata such as id, name, volume, type, and more. At the top of the panel, users will also find Hide and Isolate controls—allowing them to either temporarily remove selected objects from view or focus exclusively on them by hiding all others.
