## Interface & Navigation

The Speckle Web Viewer allows you to explore your 3D models directly in your browser. Below is a guide to help you understand the interface and how to interact with your model.

![title](/images/tool-bar-interface.jpg)

### Top Navigation

- **Workspace (Top Left):**  
  Displays your current workspace.  
  Click to switch to a different one or access workspace settings:  

- **Navigation (Top Center):**  
  Shows your location in Speckle:  
  **All Projects → Project → Model**  

- **Share Button (Top Right):**  
  Click to share the model via link or manage access permissions.

- **User Avatar (Top Right Corner):**  
  Access your account settings or sign out.

### Tools Sidebar (Left Sidebar)

From top to bottom:

1. **Models** – Manage model versions and add or remove models from the scene.
2. **Scene Explorer** – Explore your model’s data and apply filters.
3. **Discussions** – View and participate in comments and discussions within the model.
4. **Measure** – Take quick measurements directly in the 3D view.
5. **View Modes** – Switch between different visual styles (e.g., Pen, Arctic, Shaded).
6. **Views** – Change camera angles (e.g., Top, Front, Side).
7. **Fit** – Automatically center and fit the model to your screen.
8. **Light Controls** – Adjust lighting settings to improve visibility and contrast.
9. **Projection** – Toggle between perspective and orthographic camera views.
10. **Section** – Use the section box to slice through the model and inspect interior geometry.
11. **Explode Model** – Explode components of the model to better understand its structure.
12. **Free Orbit** – Allows full 360° orbiting around and beneath the model.

### Selection Info Panel (Right Sidebar)

- **Object Properties:**  
  Displays properties and metadata for the selected object, including:
  - **id**, **name**, **volume**, **type**, and more

- **Hide / Isolate Controls:**  
  Located at the top of the panel:
  - **Hide** – Temporarily removes selected object(s) from view  
  - **Isolate** – Hides everything except the selected object(s)

## Toolbar (Left Sidebar)
### Model Federation
Model federation makes it easy for different teams—like architects, structural engineers, and MEP designers—to share and combine their models without sending huge files back and forth.

Speckle lets you combine models created in different software—Revit, Rhino, AutoCAD, and more—without juggling huge files.

How it works:

1. **Publish separately.**
Each team uploads their model straight from the tool they use into a Speckle project (think a project folder that holds all the models).

2. **Assemble on demand.**
In your project, click Add in the left sidebar to bring in other models alongside the one you opened.

----> ADD HERE

3. **Combine everything.**
From the main project view, click View All in 3D. This opens the 3D Viewer and displays every model together in one scene.

### Scene Explorer
The Scene Explorer is a panel that lets you navigate your 3D model using a familiar tree view:

1. **Hierarchy view:** See models organized by levels, categories, or custom groups.

2. **Visibility controls:** Show, hide, or isolate individual objects or groups with a single click.

Use the Scene Explorer to focus on the parts of your model you care about, cleanly toggle layers, and understand the structure of complex scenes.

### Filtering
Speckle’s filtering tools let you quickly find, highlight, and analyze parts of your model based on any property or parameter:

Filter and search.

1. Open the filter panel and choose any property from your model (e.g., category, level, tag).

2. Type or select values to narrow down the list of objects.

3. Click the brush icon on the top right corner of the panel to color-code the model.

4. Query specific values. Use the search box to look for a particular value within the filtered property (e.g., all "category" Walls with “FireRating = 2”).

### Dev Mode
Dev Mode gives you a deeper look into your model’s data structure:

- **Full hierarchy view.**See every object, list, and parameter exactly as Speckle stores it.

- **Raw JSON inspection.** View and copy the underlying JSON data for any item—perfect for developers or power users.

Use Dev Mode when you need complete transparency or want to integrate Speckle data into your own workflows and applications.

### Discussions
Speckle’s discussion features help teams collaborate directly on models without switching tools:

- **Comments & Chat.** Add notes or questions to any object and chat live in the same panel. Attach comments to specific geometry for clear context, see when teammates are typing, and reply instantly.

- **Share comments link.** Generate a link to a comment or thread so teammates jump straight to the discussion in the model.

- **Attaching files.** Drag and drop images, PDFs, or other documents into threads to share references or detailed notes.

- **Saved viewer.** Lock in a specific view and comment layout. Share the exact camera angle, filters, and comments so everyone sees the same snapshot.

Use Speckle’s Discussions to keep all feedback tied to the actual model, reduce email threads, and speed up review cycles.

### Messure
Speckle’s Measure tool lets you take quick measurements directly in the 3D view:

- **Point-to-point measurement.** Click two points in the model to get the straight-line distance.

- **Perpendicular measurement.** Measure the shortest distance from a point to a line or plane.

- **Units & precision.** Switch between metric and imperial units and adjust decimal precision to suit your needs.

Use the Measure tool to verify dimensions, check clearances, and validate design details without leaving the viewer.

### View Modes
Speckle’s View Modes let you switch visual styles and tweak display settings to suit your needs:

- **Pick a style.** Pick from Pen, Arctic, Shaded and more styles.

- **Edge toggle.** Turn edge lines on or off to highlight or simplify your view.

- **Line thickness.** Easily make lines thicker or thinner for clearer outlines and emphasis.

Use View Modes to find the perfect visual setup for presenting, reviewing, or working on your model.

### Light Controls
Speckle’s Light Controls let you tweak how your model is lit to improve visibility and contrast:

- **Intensity.** Increase or decrease overall brightness to suit your environment.

- **Elevation.** Adjust the vertical angle of the light source to highlight different surfaces.

- **Azimuth.** Change the horizontal rotation of the light to control shadow direction.

- **Indirect.** Modify the amount of ambient or bounced light for softer, more realistic shading.

Use Light Controls to make sure every part of your model is clearly visible, whether you’re inspecting fine details or presenting to stakeholders.

### Projection
Speckle’s Projection settings let you switch between different camera views:

- **Perspective.** A realistic view with vanishing points, perfect for presentations and spatial understanding.

- **Orthographic.** A flat, scale-accurate view without perspective distortion, ideal for precise measurement and technical review.

### Section
The Section box lets you carve out a 3D region in your model to reveal and inspect its interior geometry. Simply position and resize the box to slice through walls, floors, or any elements, exposing hidden details for review or presentation without permanently altering your model.

### Explode
The Explode Model tool breaks your model into its individual components, spreading them apart in the 3D space. This works best for small details or products to understand how they come together.
