    Visit [speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems/) and sign up. You can join an existing workspace; otherwise, one will be created for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Connectors">
    Download and install [connectors](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors) for your software, for example, Power BI. You will need a connector to publish your first model (unless you prefer to upload an IFC, OBJ, or STL directly).
