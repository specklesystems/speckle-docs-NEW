## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to install this connector and add your Speckle account. Follow our instructions in [Speckle Manager](/user/manager) if you haven't already.

Once installed, you can find this connector in the `Add-Ins` tab under `Speckle 2`. Clicking this button will open the Speckle connector interface, which shows a list of all the projects you currently have in the model.

### Sending Data

The AutoCAD Civil3D Connector supports selection filtering by layer.

### Receiving Data

Geometry from projects will be added to AutoCAD / Civil3D layers starting with a prefix with the following format:

```
project[ model @ version id ]
```

Any layer information from the incoming project will be appended to the prefix with the standard AutoCAD delimiter `$`. When receiving from applications (like Rhino) with nested layers, the incoming full layer path will replace any default delimiters with `$`.
