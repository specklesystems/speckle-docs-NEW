SketchUp is widely used for architecture, interior design, and landscape architecture. Its ease of use, huge extension library, and 3D component library make it popular for beginners and professionals alike.

Our Speckle Connector integrates SketchUp into Speckle's connectivity ecosystem, enabling you to inspect your model & data online, share it with collaborators or receive it in other applications like Revit, Power BI, Blender etc.
