In this section, you will learn how to receive models sent to Speckle into Revit.

<Note>
We have renamed the core concepts in Speckle to be more widely understandable.

- <i>Streams</i> have been renamed to <b>projects</b>
- <i>Branches</i> have been renamed to <b>models</b>
- <i>Commits</i> have been renamed to <b>versions</b>
</Note>

## Receiving a Speckle Model

To receive a Speckle model:

1. Select a Speckle **Project.**
2. Switch to **Receive** tab.
3. Select a Speckle **Model** to receive from
4. Click **Receive**.

That's it! You will have the latest version of the selected model received.

<Tip>
If you're interested in learning more about how we handle models from CAD applications, check out [Speckle Mapper](/user/mapping-tool.md).

## Receiving a Specific Version

If you want to receive a specific version of the selected model:

1. <b>Expand</b> Receive Options by clicking on the <b>Edit</b>
2. Click on the <b>Version</b> Dropdown.
3. <b>Select the version</b>.
4. Click <b>Receive</b>.

## Receive Modes

When receiving a model that has been received before, you might want to <b>Update</b>, <b>Create</b> or <b>Ignore</b> elements that were already created before. This is when the <b>Receive Mode</b> setting comes in! This is how it works:

1. <b>Update</b>: updates elements if they already exist and creates missing ones (current behavior in Revit)
2. <b>Create</b>: always creates new elements even if pre-existing (current behavior in Rhino)
3. <b>Ignore</b>: skips elements if they already exist
