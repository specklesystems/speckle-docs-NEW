With the full release of workspace-based collaboration, personal projects in Speckle are now in read-only mode. This guide helps you migrate your existing personal project data to a workspace to continue working collaboratively.

### Why migrate?

✅ Legacy Personal projects are **read-only** - no new data can be sent to them.  
✅ Workspace projects unlock **editing, collaboration, and automation**.  
✅ Next-gen connectors require workspace-based projects.  
✅ Migrating ensures you can continue using Speckle's full capabilities with your existing data.

### Migration steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Review your personal projects">
  Go to [Speckle](https://app.speckle.systems) and sign in. In the left sidebar,
  click **My Projects** and review the personal projects you want to migrate. It
  ma not eb everything, and this is a good time to decide which projects you
  want to keep working on in a workspace as it will affect the plan selection
  that suits your needs best.
</Step>
<Step title="Create a workspace">
  If you haven't already created a workspace, in the top-right menu, click your
  profile and select **Workspaces**. Click **Create Workspace** and set up your
  workspace name, description, and invite team members.
</Step>

<Step title="Move projects into your workspace">

**From the workspace page.**

You can select **Add Project** to create a new project or move an existing one. You will be presented with a full list of all your personal projects.

**From the personal project page.**

For each project, click the **Move** button and you will be presented with a list of any workspaces you are the admin of.

</Step>

<Step title="Move your data">

Moving your project models does not upgrade it from v2 to v3 data structures. You will need to use the next-gen connector to send your data to your new workspace project.

</Step>

<Step title="Validate and start collaborating">
  Open your new project in the Speckle web interface to confirm all data
  transferred successfully. Invite collaborators as needed. Use next-gen
  connectors to keep your workspace project up to date.
</Step>
