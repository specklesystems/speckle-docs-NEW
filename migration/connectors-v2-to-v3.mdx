sidebarTitle: From v2 to v3 Connectors
---

Speckle's new next-gen connectors (v3) offer faster performance, expanded features, and a unified data model. This guide helps you migrate your workflows from legacy v2 connectors to the next-gen environment.

### Why upgrade?

✅ Next-gen connectors are **faster** and **more reliable**.  
✅ Expanded property support and **consistent schemas**.  
✅ Designed for **workspace-based projects**, enabling true collaboration.

<Warning>
  v2 and v3 connectors **cannot** be used interchangeably.
</Warning>  

### Migration steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Remove legacy v2 connectors">  
Uninstall the old Speckle plugin files from your authoring tool or remove them via your plugin manager.
</Step>

<Step title="Install next-gen (v3) connectors">  
Visit the [next-gen connectors page](/connectors/overview) for downloads and installation instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Create workspace projects">

Next-gen connectors require workspace-based projects.  
- Go to your workspace in the Speckle web interface.  
- Create a new project for each workflow you want to upgrade.
</Step>

<Step title="Re-send data using next-gen connectors">

Since v2 and v3 connectors use different data models, data migration involves re-sending your models:  
- Open your model in your authoring tool (e.g., Revit, Rhino, SketchUp).  
- Use the next-gen connector to send your model to the newly created v3 project.
</Step>

<Step title="Validate and adjust workflows">

- Open the new project in the Speckle web interface to confirm your data.  
- Adjust any scripts or automation tools to use the new workspace project structure.
</Step>

</Steps>
