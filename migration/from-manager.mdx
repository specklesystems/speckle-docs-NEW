title: Moving away from using Speckle Manager
sidebarTitle: From Manager
---

In the Next-Gen v3 Speckle connector ecosystem **Speckle Manager is no longer required** for:

- Connector updates  
- Account management (adding, removing, switching accounts)  

All of this functionality is now handled directly within each connector.

### I liked Manager, why is it going away?

While Speckle Manager provided a centralized interface for connector management and account administration, 
its requirement created an additional barrier to entry for new users. By integrating these capabilities 
directly into each connector, we've streamlined the onboarding process and enabled a more efficient 
self-updating mechanism for connectors. This architectural change allows for independent release cycles 
between legacy and current connectors. The system tray functionality previously provided by Manager 
has been replaced with a Desktop Services application integrated into the connectors themselves.

### When to still use Manager

Manager may still be useful if:

- Your organization has already **whitelisted Manager** for controlled deployment of legacy connectors. 
- You need to **retain legacy workflows** not yet supported by Next-Gen connectors.

We retain the legacy Manager documentation below for reference. [Legacy Manager Docs](/legacy/user/manager)

<Tip>If you're unsure whether you still need Manager, check with your IT or project team.</Tip>
