## Loading a Model

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in AutoCAD?">
    All objects in Speckle models are loaded as `geometry`, `text`, or `blocks` in AutoCAD. They will be created in a flattened layer structure as what you see when viewing your model in your browser. Each object will be loaded with:
    
    - Render material (if any)
    - Color (if any)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I select all the layers created after loading a Speckle Model?">
    Speckle models are loaded into their own `Selection Set`. You can use this to easily select all layers created by your loaded model.
    </Accordion>
