## Loading models

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in AutoCAD?">
    All objects in Speckle models are loaded as `geometry`, `text`, or `blocks` in AutoCAD. They will be created in a flattened layer structure as what you see when viewing your model in your browser. Each object will be loaded with:
    
    - Render material (if any)
    - Color (if any)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I select all the layers created after loading a Speckle Model?">
    Speckle models are loaded into their own `Selection Set`. You can use this to easily select all layers created by your loaded model.
    </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="The Speckle plugin is not showing up after I installed the connector">
    Make sure your version of AutoCAD is one of the supported versions. Installation issues are also sometimes caused by conflicting plugins. Please report your problem in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help
    
    And include the following information:
    
    - Your application version
    - Your Speckle connector version
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I used the Speckle command to open the connector but got an error">
    If you still have the legacy version installed, make sure you have `version 2.23` or above. Any version below 2.23 will have conflicting commands with the AutoCAD connector.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="My model has the wrong colors in the web browser viewer">
    In the viewer, select the `View Modes` button in the side bar, and switch the view mode to `Shaded`. If you still don't see your object colors, let us know in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Some objects that I published or loaded are missing from my model">
    After you publish or load a Speckle model, click on the `Report` button to see any errors that may have occurred. Click on any item in the report to highlight that item in your application. Some objects may not be supported for publishing or loading.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="The plugin UI is empty or unresponsive, or my application crashed while I was using the connector">
    For major issues, you can sometimes find a `log` file in your directory at `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`. Please report your problem in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help And include the following information:
    
    - Your application version
    - Your Speckle connector version
    - A copy of the log
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I uninstall my connector?">
    All Speckle connectors are installed like any other program. You can uninstall them directly from your system's `Applications`. For a full uninstall, you should also remove `Speckle Desktop Services` as well as your Speckle connector.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I update my connector to the latest version?">
    You can always download the latest version of the connector at https://app.speckle.systems/connectors. If a new version of the connector is available, you will also see a notification in your connector UI. [@bilal need autoupdating behavior]
