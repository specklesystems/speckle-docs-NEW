## Speckle for design coordination

Speckle is more than just a set of tools for data exchange. 
Our platform is here to redefine what *good collaboration* means in architecture, engineering, construction, and beyond:
we'll help your team execute confidently with faster, clearer, and more controlled coordination cycles.
At Speckle, we stand by a simple guideline for coordination:

<Info>
  Exchange only what you and your collaborators need to make informed decisions.

### Defining your key objective

Delivery excellence is often determined before you even publish your first model.
With Speckle, you can iterate much more quickly by supplementing traditional deliverables with key model exchanges at a cadence that minimizes poor decisions before they become design and engineering bottlenecks later on in your project.
To know how to set up your Speckle project for fast and frictionless exchange, you should:

1. Decide your Speckle scope: timeline, involved teams, and disciplines.
2. Determine your coordination goal: what do you want to achieve with your Speckle project?
3. Define your interface of exchange: what are the critical objects you need to transfer in order for involved teams to make important decisions?

    <Accordion title="Example: An architectural team coordinating with landscape architects during schematic design">
    **Scope:** 3 months
    **Goal:** A client-approved site proposal that meets programmatic and daylighting requirements
    **Interface of Exchange**: Massing model, foundation levels, ground level and entries, topography, and trees
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Example: a structural engineer coordinating with designers on floorplanning during design development">
    **Scope:** 8 months
    **Goal:** Properly sized major structural members for a design development LOD
    **Interface of Exchange**: Columns, beams, slabs, and rooms and areas
    </Accordion>

### Setting up your project structure

Once you know your coordination objective and all parties involved, each team should set up their projects accordingly.
The following is a generic template for how you and other teams should be structuring Speckle models for coordination:

- Personal project (per member) (private, used as WIP)
- Your team's Project (only team members have edit access)
    - Zone model (area of responsibility)
    - Zone model (area of responsbility)
- Coordination Project (all teams have edit access)
    - Your team's exchange model
    - Other team's exchange model

Coordination within teams can be approached in the same way as coordination between teams: for example, designers working on the facade only need the slab edge of floors to develop their area of responsibility.

<Warning>
  Coordination within teams depends on clear areas of responsibilities that should not overlap.
  Generally, avoid having objects that would exist in multiple models in your team's project: define an internal coordination model for any internal interfaces of exchange.
</Warning>

### Publishing and loading models

- Member management
- File organization
- Versioning best practices
    - version messages
    - deleting unecessary versions

### Communicate online

- Discussion threads
- Using the viewer for pre-visualization
