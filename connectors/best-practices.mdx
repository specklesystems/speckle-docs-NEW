## Speckle for design coordination

Speckle is more than just a set of tools for data exchange. 
Our platform is here to redefine what *good collaboration* means in architecture, engineering, construction, and beyond:
we'll help your team execute confidently with faster, clearer, and more controlled coordination cycles.
At Speckle, we stand by a simple guideline for coordination:

<Info>
  Exchange only what you and your collaborators need to make informed decisions.
</Info>

### Defining your key objective

Delivery excellence is often determined before you even publish your first model.
With Speckle, you can iterate much more quickly by supplementing traditional deliverables with key model exchanges at a cadence that minimizes poor decisions before they become design and engineering bottlenecks later on in your project.
To know how to set up your Speckle project for fast and frictionless exchange, you should:

1. Decide your Speckle scope: timeline, involved teams, and disciplines.
2. Determine your coordination goal: what do you want to achieve with your Speckle project?
3. Define your interface of exchange: what are the critical objects you need to transfer in order for involved teams to make important decisions?

    <Accordion title="Example: An architectural team coordinating with landscape architects during schematic design">
    **Scope:** 3 months
    **Goal:** A client-approved site proposal that meets programmatic and daylighting requirements
    **Interface of Exchange**: Massing model, foundation levels, ground level and entries, topography, and trees
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Example: a structural engineer coordinating with designers on floorplanning during design development">
    **Scope:** 8 months
    **Goal:** Properly sized major structural members for a design development LOD
    **Interface of Exchange**: Columns, beams, slabs, and rooms and areas
    </Accordion>

### Setting up your project structure

Once you know your coordination objective and all parties involved, each team should set up their projects accordingly.
The following is a generic template for how you and other teams should be structuring Speckle models for coordination:

- Personal project (per member) (private, used as WIP)
- Your team's Project (only team members have edit access)
    - Zone model (area of responsibility)
    - Zone model (area of responsbility)
- Coordination Project (all teams have edit access)
    - Your team's exchange model
    - Other team's exchange model

Coordination within teams can be approached in the same way as coordination between teams: for example, designers working on the facade only need the slab edge of floors to develop their area of responsibility.
Generally, avoid having objects that would exist in multiple zones (and therefore models) in your team's project: define an internal coordination model for any internal interfaces of exchange.

<Warning>
  Coordination within teams depends on clear areas of responsibilities that should not overlap.
  **Do not* think of 1 file = 1 Speckle model. Define your zones to fit your coordination goal instead.
  Model versions should be authored in the same application for good change tracking.
</Warning>

Once you have your project structure defined, adjust your member permissions per project, and you're ready to start coordination!

### Publishing and loading models

File organization can vary highly between authoring applications. In general, your file structure will msot likely be determined by your building execution plan.
When you're publishing and loading Speckle models in your application files, you should think of your file as having these three domains:

- Your active working objects
These are the layers or model objects that you will be working with natively as you develop your design. 
- Your reference objects
These are the objects that you will load from a Speckle model, from a collaborator.
- Your publishing objects
These are objects that you will publish to a Speckle model, for your collaborators to use. These objects are a subset of your active objects.

It is incredibly important to keep your working objects separate from your reference objects. Every time you load a new version of a reference model, it will replace the layers and objects of the previous version.
Even in applications like Rhino where you can load Speckle models as editable native geometry, you should copy and paste any reference objects you want to keep into your active layers if you want to edit them and keep them persistent in your file.

**Versioning best practices**
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Add version messages">
    Add a version message anytime you publish to an exchange model, whether it is in an external coordination project or an internal coordination model.
    Describe to your team what you've changed, and why you've changed it.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Delete erroneous versions">
    It's easy to accidentally publish the wrong objects or to the wrong Speckle model.
    Anyone that has a Speckle model loaded in their application will receive a notification as soon as a new version of that model is published.
    This means that you should promptly delete any accidental versions, to prevent a teammate from using an incorrect model while they are working.

### Communicate often and online

Don't wait for emails, WeTransfers, or a phone call: communicate directly on your coordination models using our commenting feature.
Why? Comments are tagged directly on objects. This means that you can:
- Load comments inside your modelling application
- Click on a comment, and automatically highlight that object in your modelling application.
Give and get faster feedback on new versions, and save time by no longer needing to manually search for an object inside your model based on a screenshot.

Coordination can happen on the go as well: use our model overlay feature for quick visual coordination without needing to boot up your software on your desktop.
