## Publishing a Model

<Publish app="Navisworks" />

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What types of elements can I publish from Navisworks to Speckle?">
    All visible objects in the Navisworks scene can be published to Speckle. This
    includes geometry from appended NWC, DWG, IFC, and RVT files. The export
    includes: - object geometry (as meshes) - model hierarchy - attached
    properties (from source files) - file metadata
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I publish only selected objects or specific appended files?">
    You can publish any of the following:

    <ul>
      <li>A manual selection of objects, which can include a file in the scene.</li>
      <li>A saved selection set</li>
      <li>A saved search set</li>
      <li>A saved view</li>
    </ul>

    Use the connector UI to choose which of these to send to Speckle.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I include saved timeliner information, redlines, or clash results?">
    Not at this time. The Navisworks connector currently focuses on object
    geometry and properties. Markups and clash results are not exported.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I preserve selection sets or search sets when publishing?">
    While selection and search sets themselves are not preserved as named sets in
    Speckle, as that concept doesn't yet exist on the web, you can use them as
    filters to choose what objects to send. The objects they reference will be
    exported with full geometry and metadata.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I ensure my Navisworks model is correctly positioned in Speckle?">
    The connector uses the world coordinate system as defined in Navisworks. If
    your model has an offset origin, it will be preserved in the Speckle model. To
    align with other models, ensure a consistent shared coordinate system.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My Navisworks model is in real-world coordinates, how can I move it closer to the origin?">
    You can use the **Transform** option in the Speckle connector to apply a
    translation to your model before publishing. This allows you to adjust the
    position without modifying the original Navisworks file.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do custom properties (e.g., element metadata or quantities) get published?">
    Yes. All custom properties attached to elements in Navisworks are included in
    the Speckle export. These can be viewed in the Speckle web viewer by selecting
    an object and inspecting its properties.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will properties added with DataTools be sent?">
    Yes, any properties added to objects using DataTools in Navisworks will be
    included in the export to Speckle. Ensure the properties are visible in the
    object inspector before publishing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export the model as a tree structure or a flat list?">
    By default, the connector exports objects as a flat list. If you want to
    preserve the model's hierarchy (tree structure), enable the **Preserve Hierarchy**
    option in the connector UI before publishing. Regardless of this setting, all
    elements will include a <code>path</code> property that records their original
    hierarchy within the model.
