## What Are Speckle Connectors?
**Connectors** are plugins for popular design and construction tools like Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper, AutoCAD, SketchUp, Civil 3D, Blender, and more.
They handle sending and receiving data between your software and your Speckle account.

Connectors can work with almost any kind of data, especially CAD and BIM models — including geometry and metadata.
When you send data from your software to Speckle, the connector automatically converts it into Speckle’s neutral format.
This makes it easy to open, view, or use your data in other tools — without any extra setup.

## Connector Workflows

Speckle's Next-Gen connectors support a range of workflows. Expand each level below to learn what’s possible:

<Accordion title="Business Intelligence & Presentation">
    Publish your models with rich metadata for insights and presentation — directly in the web.

    When you publish a model using a Next-Gen connector, each object is automatically sent with its geometry and key properties.  
    This enables powerful **business intelligence** workflows, such as:

    - Exploring model data in **Power BI**
    - Building automations with **Speckle Automate**
    - Querying with **Speckle SDKs**
    - Presenting and sharing models using the **Speckle Web Viewer**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Design Coordination">
    Load models in other applications for reference and coordination.

    Next-Gen connectors with **receive** functionality can load models published from any other connector.  
    You’ll get an optimized, lightweight version of the model to use as a reference in your host application — perfect for clash checks, overlays, and comparison.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Multiplayer Modeling">
    Seamless, cross-platform modeling in 3D — together.

    This advanced workflow enables real-time collaboration and interoperability.  
    You and your team can publish and receive **native objects** across different tools — as if they were created directly in the receiving application.
