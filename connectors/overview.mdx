## Publishing and Loading your models ##

In [How Speckle Works](/../get-started/introduction#how-speckle-works) we covered the basics of how data flows in Speckle. We'll now see these two core mechanisms more in detail.
The first method is by using **connectors**, this is the recommended way as it allows for much greater control.
Speckle also supports direct **file uploads** for IFC, STEP, OBJ and other formats.

## When to use connectors
Connectors are plugins that work directly inside your tools such as Revit, Blender and Grasshopper and this means you have a much higher degree of control and performance.
Connectors allow you to:
- only publish a portion of your model (for example by selection or category)
- only publish/load objects that have changes since previous versions, instead of re-uploading/downloading everything
- manage projects, models, versions directly in-app
- change tracking and notifications: be notified when changes are ready to be loaded or published 
- optimize geometry and data sets
- access additional import and export settings (detail level, project base point, merging coplanar faces etc)
- design custom workflows (eg in Grasshopper and Blender)
- (soon) open 3D comments directly inside your CAD/BIM tool

<Note>Looking for a specific connector that we don't have? [You can request it on our forum!](https://speckle.community/)</Note>

## When to use direct file uploads

In case there is no connector for your app, or you simply do not have access to a specific software, you can also
upload files directly to Speckle. We are actively looking to expand the supported file types.

- currently supported: IFC, STEP, OBJ
- coming soon: Rhino (.3dm), STL, VDA, USD, VRML/Open Inventor, SketchUp (.skp), and more
  
With direct file uploads the whole file needs to be uploaded every time, but once the model is in Speckle it'll behave very similarly to how it would if published by a connector.


<Note>Please note, file downloads are currently not possible.</Note>

Every time a file is uploaded a new version of the Speckle model is created, this allows to keep the version history of each file. New versions can be uploaded by using the drop down menu on each model.
