    All objects in Speckle models are loaded as `geometry`, `text`, or `blocks` in AutoCAD. They will be created in a flattened layer structure as what you see when viewing your model in your browser. Each object will be loaded with:
    
    - Render material (if any)
    - Color (if any)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I select all the layers created after loading a Speckle Model?">
