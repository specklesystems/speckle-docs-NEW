<Info>Speckle currently supports **Grasshopper for Rhino 7 and 8**. Grasshopper connector works on **Windows** only.</Info>

<Tip> The **Grasshopper** and **Rhino** connectors are bundled, so if you installed one, you don't need to install the other.</Tip>

## Getting Started

Welcome! This guide will walk you through how to **publish** your Grasshopper models and **load** other models using the **Grasshopper connector**.

<Note> Before you begin, make sure you have a Speckle account and [installed the Rhino and Grasshopper connector](http://localhost:3000/connectors/installation).</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Grasshopper connector">
    1. In Rhino, add your account in the Rhino connector.
    2. Open Grasshopper, and select the **Speckle** tab in the ribbon.
