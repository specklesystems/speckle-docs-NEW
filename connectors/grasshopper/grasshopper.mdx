## Setup

<Tip> The **Rhino** and **Grasshopper** connectors are bundled, so if you installed one, you don't need to install the other.</Tip>

<Steps>
    <Setup app="Grasshopper" />
    <Step title="Open the Grasshopper connector">
      1. In Rhino, add your account in the Rhino connector.
      2. Open Grasshopper, and select the **Speckle** tab in the ribbon.

## Publishing a Model

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a **Collection** with objects">
  1. Add a **Create Collection** node from the Collections category to the canvas.
  2. Connect the geometry you want to publish to the input of the **Create Collection** node.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your Speckle model link">
  1. Add a **Speckle Model URL** node to the canvas.
  2. Choose a [project]():
      - Click on the **Project** button to select a project from the dropdown
      - or use the search bar to find another project. 
  3. Choose a [model]():
      - Click on the **Model** button to select a model from the dropdown
      - or use the search bar to find another model. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your model">
    1. Add a **Publish** node to the canvas and connect your inputs:
      - Add your **Create Collection** output to the Collection input.
      - Add your **Speckle Model URL** output to the Model Link input.
    2. Click **Publish**.
    Your model is now published to Speckle and is available to the rest of your team.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How do I create properties by key value, instead of using the **Create Properties** node?">
      In Rhino 8, you can use the native Grasshopper **User Text** node to create properties by keys and values.
      Just plug the Content output of the node into any input expecting a Speckle Properties param. 
      In Rhino 7, currently there is no way to create properties by key value.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I sync my property and collection names with their inputs?">
      If you keep your params organized with their own names, then you can easily inherit these names when using the **Create Properties** or **Create Collection** nodes.
      To sync individual input names:
      - hold down the **TAB** key when plugging in your input property, objects, or collection.
      To automatically sync all input names:
      - right-click the **Create Properties** or **Create Collection** node.
      - select **Inherit all names**
      The **Inherit all names** option will lock input name editing, and always keep your input names synced with their sources.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I create new projects or models to publish to?">
      Currently, it's not possible to create new projects or models in Grasshopper. All project management should be done in your web browser.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I create specific objects for other applications like Revit or ETABs?">
      All models published in Grasshopper will only contain geometry, and will be loaded as geometry with render materials and colors in other applications (and properties, if Rhino or PowerBI). 
      We do not currently support customizing objects for specific applications.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I change my account?">
      Right click your **Speckle Model URL** node and select **Change accounts** to change your account.
    </Accordion>

## Loading a Model

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get your Speckle model link">
    1. Add a **Speckle Model URL** node to the canvas.
    2. Choose a [project]():
        - Click on the **Project** button to select a project from the dropdown
        - or use the search bar to find another project. 
    3. Choose a [model]():
        - Click on the **Model** button to select a model from the dropdown
        - or use the search bar to find another model. 
    4. Choose a [version]():
        - Latest version is loaded by default.
        - To load a specific version, click on the **Version** button and select. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load your model">
    1. Add a **Load** node to the canvas and connect your input:
      - Add your **Speckle Model URL** output to the Model Link input.
    2. Click **Load**.
    Your selected model version is now loaded in Grasshopper.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your model objects">
    1. Add a **Query objects** node to the canvas and connect your input:

    <Accordion title="How do I access object fields that I see in the web browser, but that are not in my Grasshopper object properties?">
    If you want to access geometry properties like what you would see in **dev mode** in your browser, you can use the **Deconstruct** node.
    However, if you are looking for fields on a **DataObject** - e.g. the location curve of a **RevitObject**, they currently cannot be accessed in Grasshopper.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I load a model via URL?">
    Yes. Copy your URL to a **Panel** and connect it to your **Speckle Model URL** node.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I change my account?">
      Right click your **Speckle Model URL** node and select **Change accounts** to change your account.
