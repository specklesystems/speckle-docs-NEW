Speckle for Grasshopper can integrate into nearly all of your Grasshopper workflows.

In addition to native Grasshopper, examples of integrations include:

## Shapediver

Shapediver is a tool that allows you to create Grasshopper web apps. It is a powerful 
tool that allows you to create Grasshopper web apps. Speckle has worked with the 
Shapediver team to make using Speckle with Grasshopper in their web apps seamless and secure.

## Karamba3D

Karamba3D is a parametric structural analysis tool that allows you to design and analyze 
3D trusses, beams, and shells using Grasshopper. Currently Karamba have developed a 
v2 Speckle node that wraps the Karamba3D API, allowing you to publish and receive 
structural analysis models visualising the real world appearance of the elements 
being analysed.

## RhinoInside

While there is some overlap between Speckle and RhinoInside from a purely element 
conversion perspective, their use together can be extremely powerful. Leveraging 
the version control of Speckle, the ability to modularize your Grasshopper scripts, 
the external viewing of the models as they publish from Grasshopper you can then 
harness the powerful native geometry kernel of Rhino to do some truly incredible things.

We have written a comparison of the two tools [here](https://www.speckle.systems/blog/speckle-vs-rhino-inside-revit-choose-the-best-tool-for-your-aec-project).
