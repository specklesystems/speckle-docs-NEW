### Speckle nodes

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Where can I find detailed documentation on each Speckle Grasshopper node?">
    Documentation and sample scripts are packaged with your installation of the Grasshopper connector.
    1. Open Grasshopper in Rhino.
    2. Click on **File** > **Special Folders** > **Components Folder**.
    3. Open **Speckle Sample Files** > `Speckle Grasshopper - Documentation.gh`
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Where can I find example scripts for Speckle Grasshopper?">
    Documentation and sample scripts are packaged with your installation of the Grasshopper connector.
    Our sample script contains a script for each of our main supported use cases:
    - Design Coordination
    - Business Intelligence
    - Presentation in the Web
    1. Open Grasshopper in Rhino.
    2. Click on **File** > **Special Folders** > **Components Folder**.
    3. Open **Speckle Sample Files** > `Speckle Grasshopper - Sample Scripts.gh`
    </Accordion>

### Publishing your model

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How do I create properties by key value, instead of using the **Create Properties** node?">
    In Rhino 8, you can use the native Grasshopper **User Text** node to create properties by keys and values.
    Just plug the Content output of the node into any input expecting a Speckle Properties param. 
    In Rhino 7, currently there is no way to create properties by key value.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I sync my property and collection names with their inputs?">
    If you keep your params organized with their own names, then you can easily inherit these names when using the **Create Properties** or **Create Collection** nodes.
    To sync individual input names:
    - hold down the **TAB** key when plugging in your input property, objects, or collection.
    To automatically sync all input names:
    - right-click the **Create Properties** or **Create Collection** node.
    - select **Inherit all names**
    The **Inherit all names** option will lock input name editing, and always keep your input names synced with their sources.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I create specific objects for other applications like Revit or ETABs?">
    All models published in Grasshopper will only contain geometry, and will be loaded as geometry with render materials and colors in other applications (and properties, if Rhino or PowerBI). 
    We do not currently support customizing objects for specific applications.
    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>    

### Loading your model

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How do I access object fields that I see in the web browser, but that are not in my Grasshopper object properties?">
    If you want to access geometry properties like what you would see in **dev mode** in your browser, you can use the **Deconstruct** node.
    However, if you are looking for fields on a **DataObject** - e.g. the location curve of a **RevitObject**, they currently cannot be accessed in Grasshopper.
