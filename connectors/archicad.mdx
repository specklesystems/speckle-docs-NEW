## Setup

<Steps>
    <Setup app="Archicad" />
    <Step title="Open the Archicad connector">
        1. In Archicad, select **Speckle** from the menu.
        <Frame>
        <img src="/images/connectors/archicad_toolbar.jpg" alt="Archicad toolbar" />
        </Frame>
        2. Select **Speckle** to open the Archicad connector.
        <Login app="Archicad" />
    </Step>
</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What is addon registration? What can I do if it fails?">
        If the Speckle addon doesn't appear in Archicad's Add-On Manager, or if a warning icon appears next to it, try unloading the addon and then loading it manually. You can refer to the [Archicad Add-On Manager Help](https://claude.ai/chat/link-needed) for assistance.

        If the connector installation was successful, you can find the addon file at:

        - **Archicad 28**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Archicad\v3\28\Add-Ons\Speckle.apx`
        - **Archicad 27**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Archicad\v3\27\Add-Ons\Speckle.apx`
    </Accordion>

    <SetupFaq app="Archicad" />
</AccordionGroup>

## Publishing a Model

<Publish app="Archicad" />

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What types of Archicad elements can I publish to Speckle?">
        You can publish all 3D elements that include a mesh, including:
        - `Wall`, `slab`, `beam`, `column`
        - `Door`, `window`, `curtain wall`, `skylight`, `object`
        - `Roof`, `shell`, `morph`, `mesh`
        - `Stair`, `railing`

        <Note> Elements that aren't visible in the 3D view won't be published. </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I publish models from Archicad views?">
        1. Set the **Filter** setting to **Views** while publishing a new version to your Speckle model.
        2. Select the view you want to publish from.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I publish models by Archicad element type?">
        1. Set the **Filter** setting to **Element Types** while publishing a new version to your Speckle model.
        2. Select the element types you want to publish.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see custom properties on my published Archicad elements?">
        All custom properties appear under the properties field when you select and view an Archicad object in your browser. Custom properties vary depending on the type of Archicad element, and can include:

        - Element ID, element type, element name, level
        - Classifications
        - Dimensional properties
        - Material quantities
        - User-defined properties
        - IFC properties

        <Note> For IFC properties, the property mapping of the default IFC translator determines what gets exported.</Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Publishing my model takes a long time. Can I speed it up?">
        Yes. If element properties aren't required, you can disable property extraction to speed up the publishing process.
        **To disable property extraction**
        1. Open the **Send Settings**.
        2. Turn off the **Include Object Properties** option.
        <Note> Disabling property extraction can significantly reduce publish time. </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What doesn't get published with the Archicad connector?">
        The following items don't get published:

        - 2D documentation: floor plans, sections, elevations
        - 2D elements: lines, hatches, dimensions
        - Surface textures
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Which element properties aren't published with the Archicad connector?">
        Some built-in properties under **Element Properties** > **Dimensional Properties** aren't published. This optimization improves publishing speed and avoids redundancy in the published data.
    </Accordion>

## Loading a Model

<Load app="Archicad" />

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title= "How are Speckle models loaded in Archicad?">
        All objects in Speckle models are loaded as GDL objects (generic models) in Archicad. If your model contains block instances, each instance will be loaded as its own generic model. Each object will be loaded with:
        - Render material (if any)
        - Mesh geometry

        <Note> The loaded GDL objects are organized in folders in Archicad's embedded library. The folder name is: ´Project Name - Model Name´ </Note>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How are the loaded GDL objects displayed on floor plan views in Archicad?">
        Currently, the 2D script of the GDL object generates only cut lines at the floor plan cut plane on each level. Projection lines aren't shown.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I load custom properties in Archicad?">
        Currently, you can't load any custom properties on your Speckle model objects into Archicad.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why was my Speckle model was loaded in an incorrect position?">
        If you're loading models published from Revit, ask the author of the model to publish again using the correct reference point from their Revit file. 
        For models from other applications, please request a reference coordination feature in our [Community Forum](https://speckle.community/c/features).
