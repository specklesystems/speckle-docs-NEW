## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="The Speckle plugin is not showing up after I installed the connector.">
    Make sure your version of Civil 3D is one of the supported versions. Installation issues are also sometimes caused by conflicting plugins. Please report your problem in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help
    
    And include the following information:
    
    - Your application version
    - Your Speckle Connector version
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I used the** `Speckle` **command to open the connector but got an error.">
    If you still have the legacy version installed, make sure you have `version 2.23` or above. Any version below 2.23 will have conflicting commands with the Civil 3D Connector.

    <Accordion title="My model has the wrong colors in the web browser viewer.">
    In the viewer, select the `View Modes` button in the side bar, and switch the view mode to `Shaded`. If you still don't see your object colors, let us know in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help
