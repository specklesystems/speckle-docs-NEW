## Publishing your model

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What types of Civil 3D elements can I publish to Speckle?">
    All visible types of objects supported by AutoCAD can be published from Civil 3D: `Geometry` , `Hatch`, `Text`, and `Blocks`. In addition to AutoCAD elements, any civil entity can be published as a `CivilObject`  as well, and will contain:
    
    - type
    - base curve (if any)
    - children elements (e.g. corridor baselines)
    - custom properties
    - color
    - render material    
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I publish solids from Civil 3D?">
    Solids will only be published as `Mesh` geometry.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see the custom properties on my published Civil 3D elements?">
    All custom properties can be found under the `properties` field when you select and view a Civil 3D object in your browser.Custom properties vary depending on the type of civil element, and can include:
    
    - extension dictionary
    - property set
    - Network part: part data
    - Catchment: hydrological and hydraulic props
    - Surface: statistics
    - Corridor: featurelines and codes
    - and more    
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I make sure my Civil 3D model is aligned with my other Speckle models?">
    Currently, there is no option to publish your model from a specific reference point. If you would a reference point setting for Civil 3D, please request the reference coordination feature in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/features
    </Accordion>

## Loading your model

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in Civil 3D?">
    All objects in Speckle models are loaded as `geometry`, `text`, or `blocks` in Civil 3D. They will be created in a flattened layer structure as what you see when viewing your model in your browser. Each object will be loaded with:
    
    - render material (if any)
    - color (if any)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I select all the layers created after loading a Speckle Model?">
    Speckle models are loaded into their own `Selection Set`. You can use this to easily select all layers created by your loaded model.
