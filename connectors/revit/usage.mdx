## Publishing a model

Publishing from Revit to Speckle lets you share your BIM data, including geometry and parameters, with collaborators and other tools. Visible elements are extracted and sent to your chosen Speckle stream for versioned access and integration.

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What types of Revit elements can I publish to Speckle?">
  All visible elements in the Model category (such as walls, floors, beams, and columns) can be published. In the Annotation category, only visible gridlines can be published. Each element contains the following information:

    - category, family, and type
    - level
    - location curve (if any)
    - Mesh (solid elements), Curve (model curves), or Pointcloud geometry
    - custom properties
    - render material

  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I publish models from Revit views?">
1. Click the **Settings** option while publishing a new version to your Speckle model.
2. Set the **Filter** setting to **View**, and then select the view you would like to publish from.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I publish models by Revit category?">
1. Click the **Settings** option while publishing a new version to your Speckle model.
2. Set the **Filter** setting to **Category**, and then select the categories you would like to publish.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I make sure my Revit model is aligned with my other Speckle models?">
If you are using reference points to coordinate your project, you can publish your Revit model according to a specific reference point:
1. Click the **Settings** option while publishing a new version.
2. Set the **Reference Point** setting to your desired reference point.
Your published model will now be oriented according to your specified reference point.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I see the custom properties on my published Revit elements, like parameters or material quantities?">
All custom properties can be found under the `properties` field when you select and view a Revit object in your browser.
Custom properties vary depending on the type of Revit element, and can include:

    - element id, built-in category, and workset properties
    - material quantities
    - parameters
    - structural material properties (such as density and compressive strength)

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I publish my rebar as solid objects instead of curves?">
1. Click the **Settings** option while publishing a new version.
2. Toggle the **Set Rebars As Volumetric** setting to true.
Caution: publishing all rebars as their volumetric representations can significantly slow down publishing speed. 
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Loading a model

Loading models from Speckle into Revit lets you import geometry and data from other Speckle-enabled applications. The connector creates Direct Shape elements in Revit, preserving geometry and render materials, but custom properties are not imported as Revit parameters.

<AccordionGroup>
  
  <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in Revit?">
  All objects in Speckle models are loaded as Direct Shapes (generic models) with a default category in Revit. If your model contains block instances, each instance will be loaded as its own generic model. Each object will be loaded with:
  - render material (if any)
  - `Mesh`, `Curve`, or `Solid` (only from Rhino and Grasshopper) geometry.
  </Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I load custom properties in Revit, like parameters?">
  Currently, you can not load any custom properties on your Speckle model objects into Revit.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I load a Speckle Model according to a specific reference point in Revit?">
  If you are loading a Speckle Revit model that was published with a reference point, the model will be loaded according to the transformation of that reference point. 
  Any existing reference points in your Revit document will be ignored. 
  Models published from other applications cannot be loaded according to a reference point in your Revit document.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I change the material of a Speckle model object I loaded in Revit?">
  If your Speckle model was published from Rhino or Grasshopper, it will contain
  solid geometry and you can edit the material of the created direct shape as
  you'd like. For any other Speckle model, currently it is not possible to
  change the applied material.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I change the category of a Speckle model object I loaded in Revit?">
  Currently, you can not change the category of a loaded object.
  </Accordion>
  
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

General troubleshooting steps, such as checking your internet connection, ensuring you are signed in to Speckle, and verifying you have the latest version of the Revit Connector installed, are covered in our [general troubleshooting guide](/troubleshooting). For Revit-specific issues, see the questions below.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="The Speckle plugin is not showing up after I installed the connector.">
  Make sure your version of Revit is supported. Installation issues are also sometimes caused by conflicting plugins. Please report your problem in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help 
  Include the following information:
  - Your application version
  - Your Speckle connector version
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My Speckle model was loaded in an incorrect position.">
  If you are loading models published from Revit, ask the author of the model to publish again using the correct reference point from their Revit file.
  Make sure they are using the same reference point transformations as you are. 
  For models from other applications, please request a reference coordination feature in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/features
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Loading fails if the model from Speckle is too far from the Revit origin.">
 In this case, you will need to ask the author of the model you want to load to re-publish the model closer to the origin.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Some objects that I published or loaded are missing from my model.">
 If you published a model with objects missing some pieces, this may be fixable by changing your **Detail Level** setting to **Fine**.
After you publish or load a Speckle model, click on the **Report** button to see any errors that may have occurred. 
Click on any item in the report to highlight that item in your application. Some objects may not be supported for publishing or loading.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The plugin UI is empty or unresponsive, or my application crashed while I was using the connector.">
For major issues, you can sometimes find a `log` file in your directory at `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`. Please report your problem in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help 
Include the following information:
- Your software version
- Your Speckle connector version
- A copy of the log
