## Publishing a Model

<Publish app="SketchUp" />

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What types of SketchUp elements can I publish to Speckle?">
      You can publish all types of `components`, `groups`, `faces`, and `lines` to Speckle. Each published object includes:
      - Custom user attributes
      - Render materials
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see custom user attributes on my published SketchUp objects?">
      Select an object in your browser and look under the **properties** field to view all user attributes.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why aren't my SketchUp materials applied correctly when loaded in Revit, Rhino, or Archicad?">
      This usually happens when you apply materials to **components** instead of their faces. Apply materials to **faces** for correct display in other applications.
    </Accordion>

    <PublishFaq app="SketchUp" />

</AccordionGroup>    

## Loading a Model

<Load app="SketchUp" />

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in SketchUp?">
      All objects in Speckle models are loaded as Components in SketchUp. They're created with the same layers you see when viewing your model in the browser.
      - Name of the object is loaded as component name
      - Render materials are applied.
      - Properties are loaded as user attributes.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are properties from other applications, like Revit parameters, loaded in SketchUp?">
      Yes, all parameters found under the **properties** field are loaded as user attributes in SketchUp.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see the user attributes on my loaded SketchUp objects?">
      To view them, you can use [Attribute Helper](https://extensions.sketchup.com/extension/f4d9d053-4479-4a9a-90da-b79fa16e28c4/attribute-helper) plugin from SketchUp.
