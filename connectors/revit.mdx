## FAQ

### Publishing a model

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="What types of Revit elements can I publish to Speckle?">
  All visible elements in the Model category (such as walls, floors, beams, and columns) can be published. In the Annotation category, only visible gridlines can be published. Each element contains the following information:

    - category, family, and type
    - level
    - location curve (if any)
    - Mesh (solid elements), Curve (model curves), or Pointcloud geometry
    - custom properties
    - render material
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I publish models from Revit views?">
  Click the Settings option while publishing a new version to your Speckle model. Set the Filter setting to View, and then select the view you would like to publish from. [ @bilal screenshot here ]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I publish models by Revit category?">
  Click the Settings option while publishing a new version to your Speckle model. Set the Filter setting to Category, and then select the categories you would like to publish. [ @bilal screenshot here ]
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I make sure my Revit model is aligned with my other Speckle models?">
  Use reference setting (@bjorn need to followup here, is this on publish or load)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I see the custom properties on my published Revit elements, like parameters or material quantities?">
  All custom properties can be found under the properties field when you select and view a Revit object in your browser.
Custom properties vary depending on the type of Revit element, and can include:

    - element id, built-in category, and workset properties
    - material quantities
    - parameters
    - structural material properties (such as density and compressive strength)
  </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Loading a model

<AccordionGroup>
  
  <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in Revit?">
  All objects in Speckle models are loaded as Direct Shapes (generic models) with a default category in Revit. If your model contains block instances, each instance will be loaded as its own generic model. Each object will be loaded with:
  - render material (if any)
  - Mesh, Curve, or Solid (only from Rhino and Grasshopper) geometry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I load custom properties in Revit, like parameters?">
  Currently, you can not load any custom properties on your Speckle model objects into Revit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I load a Speckle Model according to a specific reference point in Revit?">
  @bjorn need more info here
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I change the material of a Speckle model object I loaded in Revit?">
  If your Speckle model was published from Rhino or Grasshopper, it will contain solid geometry and you can edit the material of the created direct shape as you'd like. For any other Speckle model, currently it is not possible to change the applied material.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I change the category of a Speckle model object I loaded in Revit?">
  Currently, you can not change the category of a loaded object.
