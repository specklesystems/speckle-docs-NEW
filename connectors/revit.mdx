## Publishing a Model

<Publish app="Revit" />

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What types of Revit elements can I publish to Speckle?">
      All visible elements in the Model category (such as walls, floors, beams, and columns) can be published. In the Annotation category, only visible gridlines can be published. Each element contains the following information:

        - category, family, and type
        - level
        - location curve (if any)
        - Mesh (solid elements), Curve (model curves), or Pointcloud geometry
        - custom properties
        - render material
      </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I publish models from Revit views?">
      1. Click the blue **filter** field at the top of **Select objects** dialog while publishing a new version.
      <Frame>
          <img src="/images/connectors/revit_filters.jpg" alt="Revit filters" />
      </Frame>
      2. Select **Views**, and then select the view you would like to publish from.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I publish models by Revit category?">
      1. Click the blue **filter** field at the top of **Select objects** dialog while publishing a new version.
      <Frame>
          <img src="/images/connectors/revit_filters.jpg" alt="Revit filters" />
      </Frame>
      2. Select **Categories**, and then click on any number of categories you would like to add to the filter.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I make sure my Revit model is aligned with my other Speckle models?">
      If you are using reference points to coordinate your project, you can publish your Revit model according to a specific reference point:
      1. Expand the **Settings** field at the bottom of the **Select objects** dialog while publishing a new version.
      <Frame>
          <img src="/images/connectors/revit_settings.jpg" alt="Revit settings" />
      </Frame>
      2. Set the **Reference Point** setting to your desired reference point.
      Your published model will now be oriented according to your specified reference point.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see the custom properties on my published Revit elements, like parameters or material quantities?">
      All custom properties can be found under the `properties` field when you select and view a Revit object in your browser.
      Custom properties vary depending on the type of Revit element, and can include:

          - element id, built-in category, and workset properties
          - material quantities
          - parameters
          - structural material properties (such as density and compressive strength)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I publish my rebar as solid objects instead of curves?">
      1. Expand the **Settings** field at the bottom of the **Select objects** dialog while publishing a new version.
      <Frame>
          <img src="/images/connectors/revit_settings.jpg" alt="Revit settings" />
      </Frame>
      2. Toggle the **Send Rebars As Volumetric** setting to true.
      Caution: publishing all rebars as their volumetric representations can significantly slow down publishing speed. 
    </Accordion>

## Loading a Model

<Load app="Revit" />

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in Revit?">
      All objects in Speckle models are loaded as Direct Shapes (generic models) with a default category in Revit. If your model contains block instances, each instance will be loaded as its own generic model. Each object will be loaded with:
      - render material (if any)
      - `Mesh`, `Curve`, or `Solid` (only from Rhino and Grasshopper) geometry.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I load custom properties in Revit, like parameters?">
      Currently, you can not load any custom properties on your Speckle model objects into Revit.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I load a Speckle Model according to a specific reference point in Revit?">
      If you are loading a Speckle Revit model that was published with a reference point, the model will be loaded according to the transformation of that reference point. 
      Any existing reference points in your Revit document will be ignored. 
      Models published from other applications cannot be loaded according to a reference point in your Revit document.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I change the material of a Speckle model object I loaded in Revit?">
      If your Speckle model was published from Rhino or Grasshopper, it will contain
      solid geometry and you can edit the material of the created direct shape as
      you'd like. For any other Speckle model, currently it is not possible to
      change the applied material.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I change the category of a Speckle model object I loaded in Revit?">
      Currently, you can not change the category of a loaded object.
    </Accordion>
