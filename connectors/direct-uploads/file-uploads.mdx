description: "How to upload files directly to Speckle"

import Versions from "/snippets/versions.mdx";

<Info>
  Supported file formats: **IFC, STL & OBJ**.

<Versions app="IFC" versions="IFC2x3, IFC4 & IFC4x3" />

Our file import feature makes it easy for you to drag and drop files directly into your Speckle project.
Use the **file import** method when:
- you want IFC data in Speckle format
- there is no Speckle connector available for your app
- you can't or don't want to open a desktop software to view a model in your browser
- you have a file from a collaborator who isn't using Speckle.

<Note>IFC and file uploads is a beta functionality currently in development</Note>

  <Step title="Drag and drop your file">
    Drag and drop the file on the project to initiate the upload, a new model will be created with the file name.

  <Step title="Upload new versions">

## Troubleshooting
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will you support other formats for direct upload?">
    We are currently limited to open-source formats because of licensing restrictions. If there are other formats you would like to see supported, please let us know.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will you support IFC versions other than IFC2x3, IFC4 & IFC4x3?">
    We currently support whatever formats the [web-ifc project](https://thatopen.github.io/engine_web-ifc/docs/) supports which Speckle uses under the hood.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="My file is too large to upload">
    The limits on file uploads are currently 100MB for all plans and all formats.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I have uploaded a file but it's not visible">
    Once uploaded the file if it is supported is sent to the background queue to be processed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I have uploaded a file but it's still importing">
    If some aspect of the file is invalid then it may never process. Please report this to us and ideally share the file with us for debugging.
