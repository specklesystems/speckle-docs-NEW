**Publishing a Model**

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What types of ETABS elements can I publish to Speckle?">
    
    All selectable model objects can be published: `Joints`, `Frames`, `Tendons`, `Shells` and `Links`. Each published object contains the following information:
    
    - Type
    - Geometry as `Mesh` , `Curve` or `Point`
    - Children objects, such as `Joints`
    - Custom properties
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see the custom properties on my published ETABS elements, like sections or area metrics?">
    
    All custom properties can be found under the `properties` field when you select and view an ETABS object in your browser.Custom properties vary depending on the type of ETABS element, and can include:
    
    - Assignments (e.g. `material` and `section`)
    - Geometry metrics (e.g. length or area)
    - Object ID (e.g. sub-classification for `Frame` -> `Column`, `Beam`, or `Brace` , label, and associated level)
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Where can I find the material or section used for an object in my Speckle model?">

    1. Open the `Scene Explorer` tab in the Navigation Bar to the left (or press `Shift` + `E`)
    2. Click `Switch to Dev Mode`. This will give you full access to all objects and properties in your model.
    3. Expand the `sectionProxies` or `materialProxies` item.
    4. Expand any item in this list to see a `Section` or `Material` with all of its properties.The section can be matched back to any element based on its `name`, and the material can be matched to any section based on its `name`.
