Speckle's connection to Power BI consists of two parts.
- The **Power BI connector** lets you easily load your model from Speckle into Power BI in a tabular format.
- The **3D Viewer Visual** allows you to view and color your models in 3d.

</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Where do I find the 3D visual?">
        You'll find Speckle's 3D visual in the **Documents/Power BI Desktop/Custom Visuals** folder.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Where's the Model URL in the new Power BI connector?">
        The next-generation Power BI connector doesn't use Model URL input. You can safely ignore it.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why do I get an 'Access to the resource is forbidden' error?">
        This is a browser-related issue. To fix it:

        1. Go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Security**
        2. Under **Authentication Browser**, clear **Use my default web browser**
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why do I get a 'Permission denied' error?">
        You don't have the required permissions to load the model. Contact the project owner and ask them to give you the necessary permissions.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why do I get an 'Unable to connect remote server' error?">
        The Power BI connector needs Speckle Desktop Service to run on your machine. Make sure Desktop Service is active and running.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I load and visualize private projects with the Power BI connector?">
        Yes. Both the Power BI connector and 3D visual support private projects.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why doesn't my report update after a new version is published?">
        Following reasons might cause this issue:

        1. Refresh preview
            Make sure you clicked **Refresh** in the Power BI ribbon to load the latest version.
        
        2. Check if you loaded a specific version
            If your model URL contains an "@" symbol, this means you loaded a specific version. Power BI connector will only load that specific version and not any new versions.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I visualize multiple models in Power BI?">
        Here's how you can load and visualize multiple models with Power BI connector: 
        1. First, federate your models in the web app.
        2. Copy the federated model URL
        3. Load federated model in Power BI.

        Visualizing multiple models in Power BI is similar to visualizing a single model.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I control the visibility of unselected elements in the 3D visual?">
        Use the ghost icon in the 3D visual. By default, unselected elements appear ghosted. Clear the ghost icon to completely hide unselected elements.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I hide the Speckle logo from the 3D visual?">
        If you have a Business plan, you can hide Speckle branding by selecting the arrow in the top bar. Free plan users can't hide the Speckle logo.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why can I view a model in Speckle but can't load it in Power BI?">
        Viewing and loading a model require different permissions. To load a model in a connector, contact the project owner to change your project role.
    </Accordion>
