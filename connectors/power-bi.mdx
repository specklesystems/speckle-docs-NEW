Speckle's connection to Power BI consists of two parts.

- The **Power BI connector** lets you easily load your model from Speckle into Power BI in a tabular format.
- The **3D Viewer Visual** allows you to view and color your models in 3d.

        - Drag *Object IDs* column into the **Object IDs** input ->  required for **interactivity**
        - Drag any column into **Tooltip** input -> for **tooltip**
        - Drag any column into **Color by** input -> for **coloring** model
    3. Wait for your model to load in the viewer
    </Step>

</Steps>

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Where do I find the 3D visual?">
        You'll find Speckle's 3D visual in the **Documents/Power BI Desktop/Custom Visuals** folder.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Where's the Model URL in the new Power BI connector?">
        The next-generation Power BI connector doesn't use Model URL input. You can safely ignore it.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why do I get an 'Access to the resource is forbidden' error?">
        This is a browser-related issue. To fix it:

        1. Go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Security**
        2. Under **Authentication Browser**, clear **Use my default web browser**
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why do I get a 'Permission denied' error?">
        You don't have the required permissions to load the model. Contact the project owner and ask them to give you the necessary permissions.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why do I get an 'Unable to connect remote server' error?">
        The Power BI connector needs Speckle Desktop Service to run on your machine. Make sure Desktop Service is active and running.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I load and visualize private projects with the Power BI connector?">
        Yes. Both the Power BI connector and 3D visual support private projects.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why doesn't my report update after a new version is published?">
        Following reasons might cause this issue:

        1. Refresh preview
            Make sure you clicked **Refresh** in the Power BI ribbon to load the latest version.

        2. Check if you loaded a specific version
            If your model URL contains an "@" symbol, this means you loaded a specific version. Power BI connector will only load that specific version and not any new versions.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I visualize multiple models in Power BI?">
        Here's how you can load and visualize multiple models with Power BI connector:
        1. First, federate your models in the web app.
        2. Copy the federated model URL
        3. Load federated model in Power BI.

        Visualizing multiple models in Power BI is similar to visualizing a single model.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I control the visibility of unselected elements in the 3D visual?">
        Use the ghost icon in the 3D visual. By default, unselected elements appear ghosted. Clear the ghost icon to completely hide unselected elements.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I hide the Speckle logo from the 3D visual?">
        If you have a Business plan, you can hide Speckle branding by selecting the arrow in the top bar. Free plan users can't hide the Speckle logo.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why can I view a model in Speckle but can't load it in Power BI?">
        Viewing and loading a model require different permissions. To load a model in a connector, contact the project owner to change your project role.
    </Accordion>

## Helper Functions

We’ve added a series of helper functions to the `Speckle` namespace to make working with Speckle data in Power BI more efficient and user-friendly.

---

**`Speckle.Objects.Properties`**<br/>

Working with properties can be tricky—they're often deeply nested and inconsistently structured. This helper function simplifies the process.

```powerquery
Speckle.Objects.Properties(inputRecord as record, optional filterKeys as list)
```

**Description:**<br/>
Returns a record containing properties and their values from the given `inputRecord`. Optionally, you can provide `filterKeys` to extract only specific properties.

<Expandable title="Example">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/connectors/pbi_images/pbi-helper-function_1.jpg" alt="Power BI helper function" />
</Frame>
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/connectors/pbi_images/pbi-helper-function_2.jpg" alt="Power BI helper function" />
</Frame>
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/connectors/pbi_images/pbi-helper-function_3.jpg" alt="Power BI helper function" />
</Frame>
</Expandable>
---

**`Speckle.Objects.CompositeStructure`**

Use this function to extract the composite structure of an object, such as a Wall, Floor, or Roof. This is especially useful for understanding layered compositions in your models.

> **Note:** Currently only supported for Revit and Archicad models.

```powerquery
Speckle.Objects.CompositeStructure(inputRecord as record, optional outputAsList as nullable logical)
```

**Description:**  
Takes an object record as input and returns its composite structure.  
- By default, returns a record.  
- Set `outputAsList` to `true` to return the composite structure as a list—useful for expanding each layer into its own row.

</Frame>
</Expandable>

---

**`Speckle.Objects.MaterialQuantities`**

Quickly access material quantities of an object—ideal for use in Power BI's "Add Column" transformation flow, as it operates on individual records.

```powerquery
Speckle.Objects.MaterialQuantities(inputRecord as record, optional outputAsList as logical)
```

**Description:**  
Takes an object record and returns a record containing its material quantities.  
- Set `outputAsList` to `true` to return quantities as a list, which is helpful for row expansion.

<Expandable title="Example">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/connectors/pbi_images/pbi-helper-functions-materials_1.jpg" alt="Power BI helper function" />
</Frame>

</Frame>
</Expandable>

**`Speckle.Models.Federate`**

Previously, you could federate models by supplying a federated model URL. Now, you can manually federate already-loaded models in Power BI using this function.

> **Tip:** This function allows you to federate models from different Speckle projects.

```powerquery
Speckle.Models.Federate(tables as list, optional excludeData as logical)
```

**Description:**  
Accepts a list of tables (each representing a model) and returns a federated table.  
- Use `excludeData = true` to federate only the metadata necessary for 3D visuals (e.g., Version Object ID, Object IDs) without pulling in all the data.

<Expandable title="Example">
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/connectors/pbi_images/pbi-helper-functions-fed_1.jpg" alt="Power BI helper function" />
</Frame>
<Frame>
    <img src="/images/connectors/pbi_images/pbi-helper-functions-fed_2.jpg" alt="Power BI helper function" />
</Frame>
</Expandable>

---

**`Speckle.Utils.ExpandRecord`**

This function expands a record column into separate columns for each field. It's especially useful in combination with the `Properties` helper.

```powerquery
Speckle.Utils.ExpandRecord(table as table, columnName as text, optional FieldNames as list, optional UseCombinedNames as logical)
```

**Description:**  
Expands the fields of a record column (`columnName`) into individual columns in the table.  
- Use `FieldNames` to limit the expanded fields.  
- Use `UseCombinedNames = true` to prefix column names with the record column name (e.g., `Properties.Length`).
