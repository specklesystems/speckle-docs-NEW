## Getting started

Welcome! This guide will walk you through how to **load** and **visualize** a model inside Power BI using the **Power BI connector**.

Speckle's connection to Power BI consists of two parts.
- The Power BI connector lets you easily load your model from Speckle into Power BI in a tabular format.
- The 3D Viewer Visual allows you to view and color your models in 3d.

Here's how you can quickly get started with the Power BI connector:
