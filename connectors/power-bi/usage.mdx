  <Accordion
     title="Where do I find the 3D visual?">
     You'll find Speckle's 3D visual in the **Documents/Power BI Desktop/Custom Visuals** folder.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="Where's the Model URL in the new Power BI connector?">
     The next-generation Power BI connector doesn't use Model URL input. You can safely ignore it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="Why do I get an 'Access to the resource is forbidden' error?">
     This is a browser-related issue. To fix it:

     1. Go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Security**
     2. Under **Authentication Browser**, clear **Use my default web browser**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="Why do I get a 'Permission denied' error?">
     You don't have the required permissions to load the model. Contact the project owner and ask them to give you the necessary permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="Why do I get an 'Unable to connect remote server' error?">
     The Power BI connector needs Speckle Desktop Service to run on your machine. Make sure Desktop Service is active and running.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="Can I load and visualize private projects with the Power BI connector?">
     Yes. Both the Power BI connector and 3D visual support private projects.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="Why doesn't my report update after a new version is published?">
     Following reasons might cause this issue:

     1. Refresh preview

        Make sure you clicked **Refresh** in the Power BI ribbon to load the latest version.
     
     2. Check if you loaded a specific version
     
        If your model URL contains an "@" symbol, this means you loaded a specific version. Power BI connector will only load that specific version and not any new versions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="How do I visualize multiple models in Power BI?">
     Here's how you can load and visualize multiple models with Power BI connector: 
     1. First, federate your models in the web app.
     2. Copy the federated model URL
     3. Load federated model in Power BI.

     Visualizing multiple models in Power BI is similar to visualizing a single model. Refer to [Getting Started](/connectors/power-bi/power-bi) guide for more details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="How do I control the visibility of unselected elements in the 3D visual?">
     Use the ghost icon in the 3D visual. By default, unselected elements appear ghosted. Clear the ghost icon to completely hide unselected elements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="How do I hide the Speckle logo from the 3D visual?">
     If you have a Business plan, you can hide Speckle branding by selecting the arrow in the top bar. Free plan users can't hide the Speckle logo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion
     title="Why can I view a model in Speckle but can't load it in Power BI?">
     Viewing and loading a model require different permissions. To load a model in a connector, contact the project owner to change your project role.
