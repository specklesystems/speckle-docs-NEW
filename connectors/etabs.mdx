    All custom properties can be found under the `properties` field when you select and view an ETABS object in your browser.Custom properties vary depending on the type of ETABS element, and can include:

    - Assignments (e.g. `material` and `section`)
    - Geometry metrics (e.g. length or area)
    - Object ID (e.g. sub-classification for `Frame` -> `Column`, `Beam`, or `Brace` , label, and associated level)
