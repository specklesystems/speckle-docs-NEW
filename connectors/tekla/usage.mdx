## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="The Speckle plugin is not showing up after I installed the connector.">
    
    Make sure your version of Tekla Structures is supported. The installer automatically searches for Tekla Structures in two possible locations: `C:\TeklaStructures` or `C:\ProgramData\Trimble`. If you installed your application somewhere else, the installation can fail.
    
    To manually install:
    
    1. Navigate to your Tekla installation folder
    2. Go to `\Environments\common\extensions\`
    3. Create a folder called `Speckle3TeklaStructures` (if it doesn't exist)
    4. Copy the connector files from your Speckle installation directory to this location
    5. Restart Tekla
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Some objects that I published or loaded are missing from my model.">
    
    After you publish or load a Speckle model, click on the Report button to see any errors that may have occurred. Click on any item in the report to highlight that item in your application. Some objects may not be supported for publishing or loading.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="The plugin UI is empty or unresponsive, or my application crashed while I was using the connector.">
    
    For major issues, you can sometimes find a `log` file in your directory at `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`. Please report your problem in our Community Forum: https://speckle.community/c/help
    
    And include the following information:
    
    - Your application version
    - Your Speckle connector version
    - A copy of the log
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I uninstall my connector?">
    
    All Speckle connectors are installed like normal programs. You can uninstall them directly from your system's Applications. For a full uninstall, you should also remove Speckle Desktop Services as well as your Speckle connector.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I update my connector to the latest version?">
    
    You can always download the latest version of the connector at https://app.speckle.systems/connectors. If a new version of the connector is available, you will also see a notification in your connector UI.
