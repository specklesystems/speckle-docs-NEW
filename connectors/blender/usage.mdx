## Loading

**Why can't I select a project in the UIâ€”it's disabled?**
This happens when you don't have permissions to load a project. Contact the project owner to change your role.

**Can I load a model via URL?**
Yes. Next to the search box in the project selection dialog, there's an "Add model by URL" button. Paste the model URL there.

**After I load a model, can I make changes to loaded elements and will they be preserved when I load a new version?**
[Note: This question appears incomplete in the original text]

**Where are my properties?**
Currently, properties aren't loaded and attached to loaded objects.

**How are my blocks loaded in Blender?**
Blocks are loaded as linked collections. To learn more about linked collections, refer to [Blender documentation].

## Troubleshooting

**Why don't I see Speckle in the side toolbar?**
Make sure you activated Speckle connector:
1. Go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Extensions**
2. Search for Speckle
3. Select **Install**

**Why doesn't Blender connector show up under Extensions?**
Make sure you're using a Blender version that Speckle has a connector for. Blender connector currently works for Blender 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. As a general rule of thumb, we support LTS versions of Blender.

**Is it possible to use Blender connector in a version of Blender Speckle doesn't support?**
Yes. After running the installer, go to this path, copy its content and paste it here.
[Note: The original text appears to have missing path information]

**Does Blender connector work on Mac?**
Blender connector is Windows only.

**Why can't I add a new account?**
This can happen if desktop service isn't running. Blender connector needs Desktop Service to be running for authenticating new accounts. If it's not running, search for Speckle Desktop Services in Windows search and run it.
