## Publishing a Model

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="What types of objects are published?">
    All types of `Mesh`, `Bezier`, `Circle`, `NURBS Curve` and `NURBS Circle` are supported.

    <Warning>`Camera` and `Lights` are not supported.</Warning>
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why don't materials look correct in the viewer?">
    Blender connector only supports the following shaders:
    - Principled
    - Diffuse
    - Emission
    - Glass
    
    Blender will fallback to material properties if an unsupported shader is selected.
    </Accordion>

## Loading a Model

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Why can't I select a project in the UIâ€”it's disabled?">
    This happens when you don't have permissions to load a project. Contact the project owner to change your role.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I load a model via URL?">
    Yes. Next to the search box in the project selection dialog, there's an **Add model by URL** button. Paste the model URL there.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="After I load a model, can I make changes to loaded elements and will they be preserved when I load a new version?">
    You can modify **materials** and it will be preserved when you load a new version. 
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Where are my properties?">
    Currently, properties are **not** loaded and attached to loaded objects.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How are my blocks loaded in Blender?">
    Blocks are loaded as collection instances. To learn more about colection instances, refer to [Blender documentation].
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Why don't I see Speckle in the side toolbar?">
    Make sure you activated the Speckle connector:
    1. Go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Extensions**
    2. Search for **Speckle**
    3. Select **Install**
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why doesn't the Blender connector show up under Extensions?">
    Make sure you're using a Blender version that Speckle has a connector for. Blender connector currently works for Blender 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5. As a general rule of thumb, we support LTS versions of Blender.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Is it possible to use Blender connector in a version of Blender Speckle doesn't support?">
    Yes. After running the installer, go to this path, copy its content and paste it here.
    [Note: The original text appears to have missing path information]
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Does the Blender connector work on Mac?">
    Blender connector is Windows only.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why can't I add a new account?">
    This can happen if our **desktop service** isn't running. Desktop Service is used for authenticating new accounts. If it's not running, search for **Speckle Desktop Services** in Windows search and run it.
    </Accordion>
