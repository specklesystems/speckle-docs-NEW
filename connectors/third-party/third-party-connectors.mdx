description: "Third party connectors available for Speckle"

As we are moving to the new connectors era, no third party developed connectors have yet migrated to the new data model, 
but we are working with vendors and community members now we have launched the Speckle connectors.

<Note>
  These connectors are not officially supported by the Speckle team, but we are aware of them and they are available for you to use.
</Note>

[Legacy connectors exist for](/legacy/user/overview):

Those contributed by the community:
- Autodesk AdvanceSteel
- Bentley Microstation
- Bentley OpenRoads
- Bentley OpenBuildings
- Bentley OpenBridge
- TopSolid
- GSA

Some Speckle legacy connectors are also still available and not yet migrated:
- QGIS
- Unity
- Unreal
- CSI SAP2000
- CSI SAFE

If you are interested in any of these connectors to the new data model, please let us know. 
We are prioritising the developement of connectors that were historically most used, are now most requested by the community, 
most valuable workflows we wish to tackle and support, and have most backing from Speckle customers. We can support third party 
developers to create new connectivity or migrate legacy connectors with documentation and developer contact.
