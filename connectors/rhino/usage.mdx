## Publishing your model

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What types of Rhino elements can I publish to Speckle??">
    All types of visible geometry can be published, as well as `hatch`, `text`, and `blocks`. Each published object contains the following information:
    - Name
    - Color
    - Render material
    - User strings
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I publish models from Rhino layers?">
    Select "Layers" from the selection filter dropdown, and select the layers you want to publish from.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see the user strings on my published Rhino objects?">
    All custom properties can be found under the **properties** field when you select and view a Rhino object in your browser.
    </Accordion>
    
</AccordionGroup>

## Loading models

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in Rhino?">
    All objects in Speckle models are loaded as `geometry`, `text`, or `blocks` in Rhino. They're created in the same layer structure as what you see when viewing your model in your browser. Each object will be loaded with:
    - Render material (if any)
    - Color (if any) 
    - Name (if set)
    - Custom properties as user strings
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I load custom properties in Rhino, like Revit parameters?">
    Yes, all custom properties found under the **properties** field will be created as user strings in Rhino.
    </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Why isn't the Speckle plugin showing up after I installed the connector?">
    Make sure your version of Rhino is supported. Installation issues are also sometimes caused by conflicting plugins. 

    Report your problem in our [Community Forum](https://speckle.community/c/help) and include the following information:

    - Your application version
    - Your Speckle connector version
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="I used the Speckle command to open the connector, but got the legacy version instead">
    If you still have the legacy version installed, make sure you have version 2.23 or above. Any version below 2.23 will have conflicting commands with the Rhino connector.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Where is the Speckle toolbar in Rhino?">
    After installation, if you don't see the Speckle Rhino toolbar, you can manually load it:

    1. Type the **Toolbar** command in Rhino.
    2. Select **File** > **Open** and navigate to your Rhino UI folder: `AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\7.0\UI\Plug-ins`
    3. Select the **Speckle.Connectors.Rhino.rui** file and press **Enter**.

    You should now see the toolbar in Rhino.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why does my model have the wrong colors in the web browser viewer?">
    In the viewer, select the **View Modes** button in the sidebar, and switch the view mode to **Shaded**. If you still don't see your object colors, let us know in our [Community Forum](https://speckle.community/c/help).
    </Accordion>
    
    <Accordion title="Why are some objects missing from my model?">
    After you publish or load a Speckle model, select the **Report** button to see any errors that may have occurred. Select any item in the report to highlight that item in your application. Some objects may not be supported for publishing or loading.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="The plugin UI is empty or unresponsive, or my application crashed while I was using the connector">
    If you're seeing an empty Speckle UI in Rhino 8, try keeping your Speckle connector window docked to your application window, instead of floating.

    For major issues, you can sometimes find a log file in your directory at `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`. 

    Report your problem in our [Community Forum](https://speckle.community/c/help) and include the following information:

    - Your application version
    - Your Speckle connector version
    - A copy of the log
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I uninstall my connector?">
    All Speckle connectors are installed like any other program. You can uninstall them directly from your system's applications. For a full uninstall, you should also remove Speckle Desktop Services as well as your Speckle connector.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I update my connector to the latest version?">
    You can always download the latest version of the connector at [app.speckle.systems/connectors](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors). If a new version of the connector is available, you'll also see a notification in your connector UI.
