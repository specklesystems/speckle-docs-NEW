## Setup

<Tip> The **Rhino** and **Grasshopper** connectors are bundled, so if you installed one, you don't need to install the other.</Tip>
<Tip> Grasshopper is currently in **beta**. There may be bugs while the connector is still in development.</Tip>

<Steps>
    <Setup app="Grasshopper" />
    <Step title="Open the Grasshopper connector">
      1. Open Grasshopper, and select the **Speckle** tab in the ribbon.
      2. If you've already signed in from *any* Speckle connector, skip the next step.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Connect your Speckle account">
      1. If you've already signed in from *any* Speckle connector, skip this step.
      2. Add the **Sign-In** node to the canvas, and click **Sign in**.
      3. Complete the sign in process in your web browser.
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  You only need to sign in to an account once, from any Speckle connector.
  To switch accounts in Grasshopper, you can select the correct account by right-clicking the **Speckle Model URL** node.

## Publishing a Model

<Tip>
  Full documentation of all Grasshopper nodes and sample scripts are installed with your connector.
  Navigate to **File** > **Special Folders** > **Components Folder** > **Speckle Sample Files** in Grasshopper to find them.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Collection with objects">
  1. Add a **Create Collection** node from the `Collections` category to the canvas.
  2. Connect the geometry you want to publish to the input of the **Create Collection** node.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your Speckle model link">
  1. Add a **Speckle Model URL** node to the canvas.
  2. Choose a project:
      - Click on the **Project** button to select a project from the dropdown
      - or use the search bar to find another project. 
  3. Choose a model:
      - Click on the **Model** button to select a model from the dropdown
      - or use the search bar to find another model. 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your model">
    1. Add a **Publish** node to the canvas and connect your inputs:
      - Add your **Create Collection** output to the Collection input.
      - Add your **Speckle Model URL** output to the Model Link input.
    2. Click **Publish**.
    Your model is now published to Speckle and is available to the rest of your team.

  </Step>

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="How do I create properties by key value, instead of using the Create Properties node?">
      You can use the **Speckle Properties** passthrough node to create properties by key value.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I sync my property and collection names with their inputs?">
      If you keep your params organized with their own names, then you can easily inherit these names when using the **Create Properties** or **Create Collection** nodes.
      To sync individual input names:
      - hold down the **TAB** key when plugging in your input property, objects, or collection.
      To automatically sync all input names:
      - right-click the **Create Properties** or **Create Collection** node.
      - select **Inherit all names**
      The **Inherit all names** option will lock input name editing, and always keep your input names synced with their sources.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I create new projects or models to publish to?">
      Currently, it's not possible to create new projects or models in Grasshopper. 
      You can right click your Speckle model to open it in your web browser.
      All project management should be done in your web browser.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Can I create specific objects for other applications like Revit or ETABs?">
      You can create **Data Objects** which are a simplified version of the objects that are published from other connectors.
      If you assign a **builtInCategory** property to a Data Object, it will be loaded as a generic model with that category in Revit.
      However, there is currently no way to create elements that will be received as native types like walls and beams in BIM or structural applications.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I change my account?">
      Right click your **Speckle Model** node and select **Change accounts** to change your account.
