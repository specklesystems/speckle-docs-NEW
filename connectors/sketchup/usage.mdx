## Publishing your models

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What types of SketchUp elements can I publish to Speckle?">
    You can publish all types of `components`, `groups`, `faces`, and `lines` to Speckle. Each published object includes:
    - Custom user attributes
    - Render materials
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see custom user attributes on my published SketchUp objects?">
    Select an object in your browser and look under the **properties** field to view all user attributes.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why doesn't my SketchUp materials apply correctly when loaded in Revit, Rhino, or Archicad?">
    This usually happens when you apply materials to **components** instead of their faces. Apply materials to **faces** for correct display in other applications.
    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Loading models

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in SketchUp?">
    All objects in Speckle models are loaded as Components in SketchUp. They're created with the same layers you see when viewing your model in the browser.
    - Name of the object is loaded as component name
    - Render materials are applied.
    - Properties are loaded as user attributes.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are Revit parameters loaded in SketchUp?">
    Yes, all parameters found under the **properties** field are loaded as user attributes in SketchUp.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are properties from other applications (like Archicad, Tekla, Navisworks, etc.) loaded in SketchUp?">
    Yes, all parameters found under the **properties** field are loaded as user attributes in SketchUp.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see the user attributes on my loaded SketchUp objects?">
    To view them, you can use [Attribute Helper](https://extensions.sketchup.com/extension/f4d9d053-4479-4a9a-90da-b79fa16e28c4/attribute-helper) plugin from SketchUp.
    </Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Why isn't the Speckle plugin showing up after installation?">
    Make sure you're using a [supported version](/connectors/sketchup/sketchup) of SketchUp. Installation issues can also be caused by conflicting plugins. For help, post on our Community Forum and include:
    - Your application version
    - Your Speckle connector version
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why are some objects missing from my model after publishing or loading?">
    After you publish or load a Speckle model, click the Report button to see any errors. Click any item in the report to highlight it in your application. Some objects may not be supported for publishing or loading.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="What should I do if the plugin UI is empty, unresponsive, or my application crashes?">
    For major issues, you can sometimes find a log file in your directory at `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`.
    Post on our Community Forum and include:
    - Your application version
    - Your Speckle connector version
    - A copy of the log file
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I uninstall my connector?">

    Download the latest version at [app.speckle.systems/connectors](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors). If a new version is available, you'll also see a notification in your connector UI.
