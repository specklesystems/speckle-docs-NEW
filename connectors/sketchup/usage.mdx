## Publishing your models

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="What types of SketchUp elements can I publish to Speckle?">
    You can publish all types of `components`, `groups`, `faces`, and `lines` to Speckle. Each published object includes:
    - Custom user attributes
    - Render materials
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see custom user attributes on my published SketchUp objects?">
    Select an object in your browser and look under the **properties** field to view all user attributes.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Why doesn't my SketchUp materials apply correctly when loaded in Revit, Rhino, or Archicad?">
    This usually happens when you apply materials to **components** instead of their faces. Apply materials to **faces** for correct display in other applications.
    </Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Loading models

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="How are Speckle models loaded in SketchUp?">
    All objects in Speckle models are loaded as Components in SketchUp. They're created with the same layers you see when viewing your model in the browser.
    - Name of the object is loaded as component name
    - Render materials are applied.
    - Properties are loaded as user attributes.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are Revit parameters loaded in SketchUp?">
    Yes, all parameters found under the **properties** field are loaded as user attributes in SketchUp.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="Are properties from other applications (like Archicad, Tekla, Navisworks, etc.) loaded in SketchUp?">
    Yes, all parameters found under the **properties** field are loaded as user attributes in SketchUp.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title="How do I see the user attributes on my loaded SketchUp objects?">
    To view them, you can use [Attribute Helper](https://extensions.sketchup.com/extension/f4d9d053-4479-4a9a-90da-b79fa16e28c4/attribute-helper) plugin from SketchUp.
