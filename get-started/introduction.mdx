## What is Speckle?

Speckle is the data hub for the AEC industry — built to help architects, engineers, and construction teams share, manage, and automate project data.

It connects with tools like Revit, Rhino, Grasshopper, and AutoCAD, enabling smooth data exchange without file exports. Models are enriched with geometry and metadata, making them easy to view, version, and reuse.

Speckle supports real-time collaboration, design coordination, and automation — helping you keep your data connected and your workflows efficient.
This guide covers the essentials to help you get started. Let’s explore the key components that make Speckle work — and how they fit into your daily tools.

## Speckle Web App

The **Speckle Web App** lets you manage your data directly from your web browser.
It includes tools for organising projects, managing collaborators, and viewing 3D models — all in one place.

## Speckle Connectors

The Speckle Connectors are plugins you can install in popular design and engineering tools like Revit, Rhino, AutoCAD, Grasshopper, and more. They allow you to send and receive 3D models and data between your software and Speckle, so you can keep working in your usual environment while easily sharing your work with others.

Using Connectors comes with many benefits: they eliminate the need for manual file transfers, help keep your data organized, and make collaboration much easier. You can publish models along with their geometry and metadata, and bring in models from others to use as references. This makes coordination faster, reduces errors, and helps everyone stay in sync — no matter which tools they’re using.
