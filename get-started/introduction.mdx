## What is Speckle?

Speckle is the **data hub** for the AEC industry — built to help architects, engineers, and construction teams teams manage, share, and automate design and building data across tools, workflows, and collaborators — effortlessly.
Whether you’re a designer, engineer, BIM manager, developer, or project stakeholder, Speckle gives you a smarter way to work with your data.

## Why Speckle?

- **Built for AEC**: Speckle understands the complexity of AEC data. It handles geometry, metadata, version history, and relationships between elements — all without flattening or losing meaning.
- **Effortless Data Exchanges**: Say goodbye to file-based limitations. Speckle connects your favorite tools — like Revit, Rhino, Grasshopper, SketchUp, Blender, AutoCAD, Unity, Excel, PowerBI and more — so you can send and receive data without friction.
- **Web-Based Collaboration**: Speckle brings your models to life in the web, making it easy to share, view, and discuss — no special software or plugins required.
- **Open, Flexible, and Extensible**: Speckle is fully open source. Use it as-is, extend it to fit your workflow, or build custom apps and automations on top of it. It’s designed to grow with your needs.


## How Speckle Works

Speckle works without files, it essentially unlocks you models from proprietary formats and desktop files.

To do this, Speckle relies on a set of integrations, called Connectors. These are lightweight plugins that integrate directly into the software you already use, such as: Revit, Rhino & Grasshopper, Blender etc.

Connectors publish your models to Speckle without relying on files, essentially every piece of geometry or metadata is extracted and uploaded. 

Once your models are published to Speckle, they are stored securely in our cloud.

Speckle also supports file uploads for formats like IFC, OBJ and STL directly from its web app.

Speckle models are not only securely stored and versioned in our cloud, they can be consumed in a variety of ways:

- you can load them back inside other software (for example Revit or PowerBI), via the Connectors - again, no files needed
- by viewing and sharing them from the Web App and our powerful 3D Viewer (for example by embedding them in Miro, or sharing a link to your coworkers)
- or with custom apps you can develop thanks to our Developer Platform

## What can you do with Speckle

- **Streamline Designs**: with Speckle you can iterate designs faster as it allows you to effortlessly exchange data and models across different software. Share only what's needed and easily coordinate with other disciplines. 
- **Gain Insights**: our PowerBI connectors makes it extremely easy to create custom interactive dashboards and consume BIM and other AEC data so you can easily share progress and insights with all stakeholders.
- **Review Models Online**: say goodbye to PDF annotations and screensharing sessions. Version history, real time follow mode, model federation and 3D comments make model review sessions a breathe.
- **Share and Present**: Speckle's powerful 3D viewer allows you to share interactive 3D models with just a link or to embed them anywhere. No desktop software or technical knowledge needed! Oh, and viewers are **free** in Speckle!
- **Build Custom Applications**: don't reinvent the wheel - Speckle provides you all the building blocks to develop custom apps, integrations and automations no matter the complexity.
- **Data Warehousing**: futureproof your business's IP by storing all your designs in a transparent and secure cloud. You own your data, it's our promise to you.
