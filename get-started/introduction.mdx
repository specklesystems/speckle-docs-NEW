## What is Speckle?

Speckle is the **data hub** for the AEC industry — built to help architects, engineers, and construction teams teams manage, share, and automate design and building data across tools, workflows, and collaborators — effortlessly.
Whether you’re a designer, engineer, BIM manager, developer, or project stakeholder, Speckle gives you a smarter way to work with your data.

### Why Speckle?

- **Built for AEC**: Speckle understands the complexity of AEC data. It handles geometry, metadata, version history, and relationships between elements — all without flattening or losing meaning.
- **Effortless Data Exchanges**: Say goodbye to file-based limitations. Speckle connects your favorite tools — like Revit, Rhino, Grasshopper, SketchUp, Blender, AutoCAD, Unity, Excel, PowerBI and more — so you can send and receive data without friction.
- **Web-Based Collaboration**: Speckle brings your models to life in the web, making it easy to share, view, and discuss — no special software or plugins required.
- **Open, Flexible, and Extensible**: Speckle is fully open source. Use it as-is, extend it to fit your workflow, or build custom apps and automations on top of it. It’s designed to grow with your needs.


### How Speckle Works

It all starts with freeing you models from proprietary formats and desktop files, and this is because Speckle works without files.

To help you move AEC data and designs across tools and share it with others, Speckle relies on a set of integrations, called Connectors.
These are lightweight plugins that integrate directly into the software you already use, such as: Revit, Rhino & Grasshopper, Blender etc.

Connectors publish your models to Speckle without relying on files, essentially every piece of geometry or metadata is extracted and uploaded. The same happens when loading models into another application - all without using files.
Say goodbye to complex export and import settings, naming standards and clunky file storage systems!

Speckle also supports file uploads for formats like IFC, OBJ and STL directly from its web app.

Once your models are published to Speckle, they are stored securely in our cloud, and you can consume them in a variety of ways:

- by loading them inside other tools, via the Connectors
- by viewing and sharing them from the Web App and our powerful 3D Viewer
- or via code and custom apps developed with our Developer Platform
