## What is Speckle?

Speckle is a one of a kind design collaboration platform.

It replaces file-based workflows with live connections between CAD and BIM tools. It keeps teams in sync without any manual exports, version conflicts, or even the need for a specialized software license. 

Speckle gives you a smarter and faster way to track, and automate design and building data across tools, workflows, and stakeholders. Whether you’re designing, engineering, building, managing, or approving—Speckle makes your model data work for you, not against you.

## Why Speckle?

- **Built for AEC**  
Speckle gets the complexity of AEC data. It handles geometry, metadata, version history, and relationships between elements, all without flattening or losing meaning.
- **Makes data exchange look easy**  
Speckle connects your favorite tools; like Revit, Rhino, Power BI, Grasshopper, SketchUp, Blender, AutoCAD, Archicad and more, so you can send and receive model data without skipping a beat.
- **Teamwork online**  
Speckle brings your models to life on the web, making it easy to share, view, and discuss—no special software or plugins needed.
- **Open, flexible, and extensible**
Speckle is fully open source. Use it as-is, extend it to fit your workflow, or build custom apps and automations on top of it. It’s designed to grow with your needs.


## How Speckle Works

Speckle works without files to unlock your models from proprietary formats and desktop files.

To do this, Speckle relies on a set of integrations, called **connectors**. These are lightweight plugins that integrate directly into the software you already use, such as: Revit, Rhino & Grasshopper, Blender, etc.

Connectors publish your models to Speckle without relying on files—every piece of geometry or metadata is extracted and uploaded. Once your models are published to Speckle, they are stored securely in our cloud.

Speckle also supports drag & drop file uploads for formats like IFC, OBJ and STL directly in the web app.

Speckle models are not only securely stored and versioned in our cloud, they can be consumed in a variety of ways:

- Load them back inside other apps (for example Revit or Power BI), via the connectors. Again, no file exports needed!
- View and share them from the Speckle web app and our powerful online 3D viewer (for example by embedding them in a Miro board, or sharing a link to your coworkers).
- Take your models further into custom apps you can develop thanks to Speckle’s Developer Platform.

## What can you do with Speckle

- **Exchange designs**  
With Speckle you can iterate designs faster as it allows you to exchange data and models across different tools. Share only what’s needed and easily coordinate with other disciplines!
- **Get Insights**  
The Power BI connector makes it extremely easy to create custom interactive dashboards and consume BIM and other AEC data so you can share progress and insights with stakeholders.
- **Present and review models**  
Speckle’s online 3D viewer lets you present and share interactive models with a simple link—or embed them anywhere you like. No desktop software or technical skills required. And best of all, viewers are free in Speckle.

It’s perfect for model reviews too, with features like version history, real-time follow mode, model federation, and 3D comments pinned to objects.
- **Build custom tools**
You don’t have to reinvent the wheel! Speckle provides you all the building blocks to develop custom apps, integrations and automations, no matter the complexity.
- **Data warehousing**
Futureproof your business’ IP by storing all your designs in a transparent and secure cloud. You own your data, it’s our promise to you.
