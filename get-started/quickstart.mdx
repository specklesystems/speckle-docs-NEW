<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Visit [speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems/) and sign up. You can join an existing workspace; otherwise, one will be created for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Connectors">
    Download and install [connectors](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors) for your software, for example, Power BI. You will need a connector to publish your first model (unless you prefer to upload an IFC, OBJ, or STL directly).

    ![install](/images/intro-short%20power%20bi%20gif%20final%20email%20.gif)
    
    <Warning>Make sure that the target software is closed during the installation process.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the connector and log in">
    Launch the software and look for the **Speckle** tab or menu, then click the Speckle icon to open the Connector panel.

You can now log in with your account.

<Note>If you cannot find the Speckle connector, check the dedicated guide page for[the connector of your software](../connectors/overview).</Note>
   
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your first model">
    With the Speckle panel open, click **Publish**.
