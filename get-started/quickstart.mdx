<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Visit [speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems/) and sign up. You might have the option to join an existing Workspace otherwise one will be created for you.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Connectors">
    Download and install [connectors](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors) for your software, for example Rhino. You will need a connector to publish your first model (unless you prefer to upload an IFC directly).

    <Warning>Ensure that the target software is closed during the installation process.</Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch the Connector and Log In">
    Launch the software and look for the **Speckle** tab or menu, then click the Speckle icon to open the Connector panel.

    You can now log in with your account.

<Warning>If you cannot find the Speckle connector, check the dedicated guide page for your [software](../connectors/overview).</Warning>
   
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your first model">
    With the Speckle panel open, click **Publish**.<br />

    Select the destination for your model:
      - **Workspace** – Pick a workspace 
      - **Project** – Choose an existing project or click the **+** button to create a new one  
      - **Model** – Select or create a model to use  

    Finally, click **Publish**!
