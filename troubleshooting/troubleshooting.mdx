  [TODO]
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Speckle plugin is not showing up after I installed the connector.">
  Ensure that the connector was installed for the correct version of your
  application. You can re-run the installer and verify the plugin or add-in is
  enabled in your application's extensions or add-ins menu.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Some geometry didn't publish. Why?">
  Some geometry types (such as proxies or point clouds) may not be fully
  supported in your host application. Also, make sure the objects were visible
  and selected during export.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My published model appears in the wrong location in Speckle.">
  This may be due to an internal origin or transformation applied in Na
  visworks. Double-check the file's world coordinates and any model
  transformations.
</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The plugin UI is empty or unresponsive, or Navisworks crashes when using the connector.">
  Try restarting Navisworks. If issues persist, check your log file in `AppData\Roaming\Speckle\Logs`. Post the details in our [community forum](https://speckle.community/c/help) along with:

<ul>
<li>Your version of Navisworks</li>
<li>Your version of the Speckle connector</li>
<li>A copy of the log</li>
</ul>

<Accordion title="How do I uninstall my connector?">
  Go to your system's Applications and uninstall the Speckle Navisworks
  Connector like any other program. Also consider uninstalling Speckle Manager
  and Desktop Services if no longer needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I update my connector to the latest version?">
  You can also download the latest release directly from the [Speckle
  website](https://app.speckle.systems/connectors). The connector will notify 
  you when a new version is available.
