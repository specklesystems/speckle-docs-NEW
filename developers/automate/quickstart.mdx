---


## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A verified account on [app.speckle.systems](https://app.speckle.systems)

<Tip>
üí° You must verify your account by responding to the email sent to you upon sign-up.
</Tip>
- An account on [github.com](https://github.com)

<Note>
üîß **GitHub Integration**: GitHub is currently the default platform for function development and deployment. We're working on supporting additional platforms to make Automate more flexible for all users.
</Note>

## User Interface

As part of the public beta, Automate is now fully integrated into the main Speckle web application interface. You can access it by navigating to a project that you are the owner of:

<Frame>

</Frame>
<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your First Function">
    - Navigate to a Workspaces-hosted project where you are a collaborator
    - Go to the **Automations** tab and select **View Functions**
    - Click **New Function** in the top right
    - Follow the [function creation wizard](/developers/automate/create-function) to set up your project

    <Tip>
    üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The wizard automatically creates a GitHub repository, GitHub Actions workflow, and injects necessary environment variables.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Develop Your Function">
    - **Open the Repository**: View your project on GitHub.
    - **Open in Codespace**: Start coding immediately in a virtual environment.
    - **Customize Your Function**: Edit the template code to implement your business logic.
    - **Test Locally**: Use the [testing utilities](/developers/automate/function-testing) to validate your function.
    - **Make a Release**: Create a GitHub release to deploy your function.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Your First Automation">
    - Go to the **Automations** tab in your project
    - Click **New Automation**
    - Select your function from the library
    - Configure function inputs and parameters
    - Choose a Speckle model to trigger the automation
    - Name your automation and click **Create**

    For detailed instructions, see [Creating Automations](/developers/automate/create-automation)
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Results">
    Once your automation runs:

    - **Model Scene View**: Look for the results "doughnut" icon in the 3D viewer
    - **Project Dashboard**: Check the model list for automation indicators
    - **Results Details**: Click on run cards to see detailed results and artifacts

    For more details, see [Viewing Results](/developers/automate/viewing-results).
  </Step>
</Steps>
