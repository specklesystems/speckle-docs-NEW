We are actively working to improve Speckle Automate and value your feedback. If you encounter any issues, please report them to the Speckle team.

## Current Known Issues

### GitHub Authentication Permissions
<Warning>
  When creating a Function via Automate, the system currently uses a legacy GitHub app that requests broad permissions. This may be a concern for organizations with strict security policies around GitHub access.
  
  **Status**: We are working on migrating to the new GitHub App with fine-grained permissions to address this security concern.
  
  **Action**: If this affects your organization's ability to adopt Automate, please contact the Speckle team for updates on the migration timeline.
</Warning>

### Automation Revision Errors
<Warning>
  Some users may encounter "Specified automation revision does not exist" errors (AutomateInvalidTriggerError) when triggering automations.
  
  **Status**: This issue is under investigation to determine if it's caused by user error, server logic issues, or false positives.
  
  **Action**: If you encounter this error, please report it to the Speckle team with details about when it occurred and what you were doing at the time.
</Warning>

### Run Status Errors
<Warning>
  Some users may encounter errors when setting run status from `SUCCEEDED` to `SUCCEEDED`, which can affect automation execution tracking.
  
  **Status**: This issue is under investigation to determine the root cause and implement a fix.
  
  **Action**: If you encounter this error, please report it to the Speckle team with details about your automation configuration and when the error occurred.
</Warning>

### Function Deletion
<Info>
  Currently, there is no ability to delete functions once they have been created in Speckle Automate.
  
  **Status**: This feature is planned for future development.
  
  **Action**: If you need to remove a function, please contact the Speckle team for assistance.
</Info>

### Function Version Changes
<Info>
  When upgrading the released function version used in an automation, previously configured input values (including secrets) are lost and need to be re-entered.
  
  **Status**: This behavior is being reviewed for improvement to allow keeping existing values where the input schema remains unchanged.
  
  **Action**: Be prepared to re-enter input values when updating function versions in your automations.
</Info>

### Hardware-Specific Deployment
<Info>
  Currently, Automate runs cannot be deployed to specific hardware configurations (e.g., GPU-enabled nodes, high memory, specific CPU types, Windows nodes).
  
  **Status**: This feature is planned for future development to allow control over node selection for different types of workloads.
  
  **Action**: If your functions require specific hardware configurations, please contact the Speckle team to discuss current limitations and future plans.
</Info>



### OAuth2 Authentication Flows
<Note>
  Currently, Speckle Automate only supports token-based authentication for third-party services. OAuth2 authorization code flows are not yet available for seamless integration with services that require user consent and dynamic token management.
  
  **Status**: OAuth2 authentication flows are planned for future development to streamline integration with services like Google, Microsoft, and Autodesk.
  
  **Action**: For now, use manual token entry for services that require OAuth2. If you need OAuth2 support for specific integrations, please contact the Speckle team.
