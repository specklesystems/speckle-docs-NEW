title: Server Architecture
description: The Speckle server is designed as a modular, scalable system that can handle everything from small team deployments to enterprise-scale installations. This page provides a high-level overview of the server architecture and its components.
---

## Overview

The Speckle server follows a microservices architecture pattern, with each component responsible for specific functionality while communicating through well-defined APIs. This design allows for:

- **Scalability**: Components can be scaled independently
- **Reliability**: Failure in one component doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Maintainability**: Each component can be updated and maintained separately
- **Flexibility**: Components can be deployed on different infrastructure as needed

## Core Services

### API Server

The central component that handles all client requests and business logic.

**Responsibilities:**
- Authentication & Authorization
- Project Management
- Data Operations
- User Management
- Webhook Management

### Frontend

The web interface for managing Speckle projects and data.

**Responsibilities:**
- User Interface
- Data Visualization
- User Management
- Project Administration

### Supporting Services

- **Preview Service**: Generates object previews headlessly
- **Webhook Service**: Handles external webhook calls and integrations
- **File Import Service**: Parses and imports various file formats
- **Database monitor**: Generates statistics related to the stored data

## Required Dependencies

### Database (PostgreSQL)

PostgreSQL serves as the primary database for all relational data including user accounts, projects, object metadata, and activity logs.

### Object Storage (S3-compatible)

Object storage handles the actual 3D data and file assets. We require an S3-compatible blob storage, such as AWS S3 or MinIO.

### Cache Layer (Redis-compatible)

The cache layer provides caching and session management capabilities, serving as the Redis-compatible open-source alternative.

**Cached Data:**
- User Sessions
- Rate Limiting
- Messages between supporting services and the API server

### Email server (SMTP-compatible)

This handles all transactional emails to users, including account email verification. We recommend using an externally provided email service which is SMTP compatible.
