## Overview

Speckle server can be deployed using several different methods, each suited for different use cases, team sizes, and technical requirements. The choice of deployment method depends on factors such as:

- **Team size** and expected user load
- **Technical expertise** available
- **Infrastructure requirements** and budget
- **Scalability needs** and growth plans
- **Security and compliance** requirements
- **Maintenance preferences** and resources

## Deployment Methods

<Note>
  **Need Help Choosing?** If you're unsure which deployment method is right for
  you, start with Docker Compose for most use cases. It provides the best
  balance of simplicity, functionality, and cost-effectiveness.

### Docker Compose (Recommended for most users)

**Best For:** Small to medium teams, organizations starting with Speckle, cost-conscious deployments

**Key Benefits:**

- **Simple Setup**: Single command deployment with minimal configuration
- **Cost Effective**: Runs on any Linux server with Docker support
- **Full Control**: Complete control over infrastructure and configuration
- **Easy Maintenance**: Simple update and backup procedures
- **Production Ready**: Includes SSL, monitoring, and backup capabilities

**Technical Requirements:**

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Linux server with 4GB+ RAM and 20GB+ storage
- Domain name and SSL certificate
- Basic Linux administration knowledge

**Use Cases:**

- Teams of 5-50 users
- Organizations wanting full control over their data
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Proof of concept and testing environments
- Educational institutions and research organizations

**Limitations:**

- Single server deployment (no built-in high availability)
- Manual scaling required
- Limited to single geographic location
- Requires manual maintenance and updates

### Kubernetes (Enterprise & Production)

**Best For:** Large organizations, enterprise deployments, high-availability requirements

**Key Benefits:**

- **High Availability**: Multi-node deployment with automatic failover
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic scaling based on load and resource usage
- **Global Deployment**: Multi-region and multi-cloud deployments
- **Advanced Orchestration**: Rolling updates, health checks, and auto-recovery
- **Enterprise Features**: Load balancing, ingress management, and monitoring

**Technical Requirements:**

- Kubernetes cluster (v1.20+) with at least 3 nodes
- kubectl and Helm package manager
- Ingress controller and storage classes
- Domain name and SSL certificates
- Kubernetes administration expertise

**Use Cases:**

- Enterprise organizations with 50+ users
- High-availability production environments
- Multi-region deployments
- Organizations with existing Kubernetes infrastructure
- Applications requiring advanced orchestration

**Limitations:**

- High complexity and learning curve
- Requires significant infrastructure resources
- Expensive for small deployments
- Requires specialized Kubernetes knowledge
