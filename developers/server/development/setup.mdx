description: Complete guide to get Speckle server running locally for development, testing, and contribution
---

<Note>
  **Development vs Production**: This setup is for development and testing only.
  For production deployment, use the [Docker
  Compose](/developers/server/deployment/docker-compose) or
  [Kubernetes](/developers/server/deployment/kubernetes) guides.
</Note>

## Project Structure

The Speckle server is organized as a monorepo with the following key packages:

- **`packages/server`**: Main API server (Node.js)
- **`packages/frontend-2`**: Web interface (Vue.js)
- **`packages/viewer`**: 3D viewer (Three.js)
- **`packages/preview-service`**: Preview image generation
- **`packages/webhook-service`**: Webhook processing
- **`packages/fileimport-service`**: File import processing

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your development environment, ensure you have:

- **Git** for version control
- **Node.js** (check package.json engines field for version requirements)
- **Docker and Docker Compose** for containerized services
- **GitHub SSH key** (optional, for SSH-based cloning)

## Supported Platforms

Speckle server has been developed on Linux, Windows WSL2, and MacOS. It _does not_ work on Windows without WSL2.

On MacOS devices with Apple based chips (M2, M3 etc.) it is possible to run the server as described below, but building and running Dockerfiles takes a lot of time (due to emulation of an x86 platform).

## Setup Instructions

To run a barebones Speckle Server, you need to run:

- the `frontend-2` package (Vue.js web interface)
- the `server` package (Node.js API server)

Optionally, to enable extra functionality, microservices should be run separately:

- the `preview-service` package generates preview images for streams
- the `webhook-service` package is responsible with calling the configured webhooks
- the `fileimport-service` package parses and imports uploaded files into Speckle

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone and setup repository">
```bash 
git clone git@github.com:specklesystems/speckle-server.git cd
speckle-server corepack enable yarn yarn build 
```
</Step>
<Step title="Start Docker services">
```bash 
yarn dev:docker:up 
```
</Step>
<Step title="Configure environment files">
```bash 
cp packages/server/.env.example packages/server/.env 
cp packages/server/.env.test-example packages/server/.env.test 
cp packages/frontend-2/.env.example packages/frontend-2/.env 
```
</Step>

<Step title="Start development server">
```bash 
yarn dev 
```
</Step>
<Step title="Wait for the frontend to build">
  Wait for the Vue.js frontend to build, and you have a fully functional Speckle
  Server running at `http://localhost:3000`.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Don't forget to set up the variables in the `.env` & `.env.test` files
  according to your deployment
</Warning>


In this deployment type, the Vue.js frontend app will listen by default on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 8080`, but will have no knowledge about the `server` component, and thus **should not be accessed directly**.

The Node.js server component will listen on the local interface (not available over the network) on `port 3000`, and will proxy the frontend requests to the Vue.js frontend component (as configured in .env file).
