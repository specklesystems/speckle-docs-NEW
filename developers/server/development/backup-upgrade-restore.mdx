title: Backup, Upgrade & Restore
description: Database backup, upgrade, and restore for Speckle server
---

We recommend backing up your database regularly, and especially prior to upgrading Speckle. Backing up a database is often a requirement of a database upgrade, migrating your database between servers, or recovering from an incident.

Speckle's preferred method of backing up and restoring data in a Postgres database is with pgAdmin. This guide assumes you are running Speckle via Docker-Compose.

## Prerequisites

1. Docker should be installed and running
2. Manual installation instructions should have been completed

## Setup pgAdmin

<Steps>
<Step title="Check and start pgAdmin">
Check if pgAdmin is already running:
```bash
docker ps --filter name='pgadmin'
```

If not running, create `docker-compose-pgadmin.yml` with the following configuration:
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4
    restart: always
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: 'admin@localhost.com'
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: 'admin'
    volumes:
      - pgadmin-data:/var/lib/pgadmin
    ports:
      - '127.0.0.1:16543:80'
networks:
  default:
    name: speckle-server
volumes:
  pgadmin-data:
```

Then start pgAdmin:
```bash
docker compose --file docker-compose-pgadmin.yml up --detach
```
</Step>

<Step title="Access pgAdmin">
Find the pgAdmin port and access the dashboard:
```bash
docker ps --filter name='pgadmin'
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:16543/` in your browser (replace 16543 with your actual port).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Backup

<Steps>
<Step title="Backup database">
Connect to pgAdmin, then connect to your Postgres server. Right-click on the `speckle` database, select `Backup...`, choose a location, and click `Backup` to start the process.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Upgrade

<Steps>
<Step title="Deploy new version">
Clone the Speckle Server repository and deploy the updated version:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/specklesystems/speckle-server.git
cd speckle-server
git checkout tags/2.9.0 -b main
docker compose -f ./docker-compose-deps.yml up --detach
```
</Step>

<Step title="Verify deployment">
Check that all containers are running:
```bash
docker ps
```
</Step>

<Step title="Stop and clean up old database">
⚠️ **CAUTION** This will cause Speckle to stop working until restored. Notify users before proceeding.

Stop and remove the old Postgres container:
```bash
docker stop speckle-server-postgres-1
docker rm speckle-server-postgres-1
```

Find and delete the database volume:
```bash
docker volume ls --filter name='postgres'
docker volume rm speckle-server_postgres-data
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Restore

<Steps>
<Step title="Transfer and restore backup">
If needed, transfer your backup file to the host machine, then copy it to the pgAdmin container:
```bash
docker cp BACKUP_FILE_NAME speckle-server-pgadmin-1:'/var/lib/pgadmin/storage/admin_localhost.com/'
```

Connect to pgAdmin, create a new `speckle` database, then right-click it and select `restore` to load your backup.
</Step>

<Step title="Verify restoration">
Deploy Speckle server if not already running and verify the data is correct.
</Step>
</Steps>

Your database has been successfully backed up, upgraded, and restored. Regular backups are recommended as part of your maintenance routine, regardless of whether you're performing upgrades.
