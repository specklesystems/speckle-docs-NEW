title: Full Migration
---

The encouraged way, is to conform to the new API as soon as possible. The following 
guide will attempt to help with the initial migration from the old API to the new one.

### Extensions:

A lot of existing viewer functionality has been transferred over to modular `Extensions`. 
In order to continue to make use of this functionality, the viewer clients now need to 
explicitly enable extensions by calling `createExtension` with the extension's constructor 
as the argument. For example, the complete functionality set requires all the extensions 
enabled.

```typescript
const cameraController = this.createExtension(CameraController)
const selection = this.createExtension(LegacySelectionExtension)
const sections = this.createExtension(SectionTool)
const sectionOutlines = this.createExtension(SectionOutlines)
const measurements = this.createExtension(MeasurementsExtension)
const filtering = this.createExtension(FilteringExtension)
const explodeExtension = this.createExtension(ExplodeExtension)
const diffExtension = this.createExtension(DiffExtension)
```

### General:

- `ViewerParams`no longer has a `keepGeometryData` property. Redundant geometry 
  data is by default removed and cannot be kept
- `SectionBoxChanged` and `SectionBoxUpdated` removed from `ViewerEvent` and replaced 
  by `SectionToolEvent.Updated` in `SectionTool` extension
- `SelectionEvent.hits` changed to `Array<{node: TreeNode, point: Vector3}>`
- `requestRender` from `Viewer` now takes optional `UpdateFlags`
- `getObjects` removed from `Viewer`. Similar functionality exists with `getObject` 
  in `SpeckleRenderer`
- `explode` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by having an `ExplodeExtension` active. 
  Explode time is now controller via `setExplode` in `ExplodeExtension`
- `getDataTree` and `DataTree` type still exist, but are deprecated and will be 
  soon removed completely. Any functionality can now be replicated with `WorldTree`
- `cameraHandler` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `controls` accessor in `CameraController`.

### Section Box:

- `setSectionBox` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `setBox` in`SectionTool`
- `getSectionBoxFromObjects` removed from `Viewer`  and replaced by `boxFromObjects` 
  from `SpeckleRenderer`
- `getCurrentSectionBox` removed from `Viewer` and replace by `getCurrentBox` in`SectionTool`
- `toggleSectionBox` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `toggle` in `SectionTool`
- `sectionBoxOff` and `sectionBoxOn` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by the `enabled` 
  accessor in `SectionTool`

### Camera:

- `zoom` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `setCameraView` in `CameraController` 
  extension
- `toggleCameraProjection` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `toggleCameras` in 
  `CameraController` extension
- `setView` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `setCameraView` in `CameraController` 
  extension
- `loadObject` signature changed to `loadObject(loader: Loader, zoomToObject?: boolean)` 
  and it's now asynchronous
- `loadObjectAsync` removed from `Viewer`

### Diffing:

- `diff` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `diff` in `DiffExtension`
- `undiff` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `undiff` in `DiffExtension`
- `setDiffTime` and `setVisualDiffMode` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by 
  `updateVisualDiff` in `DiffExtension`

### Filtering and Selection:

- `applyFilter` removed from `Viewer`
- `getObjectProperties` is now asynchronous
- `showObjects` and `hideObjects` are removed from `Viewer` and moved to `FilteringExtension`
- `isolateObjects` and `unIsolateObjects` are removed from `Viewer` and moved to `FilterinExtension`
- `selectObjects` is removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `selectObjects` in `SelectionExtension`
- `resetSelection` is removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `clearSelection` in `SelectionExtension`
- `highlightObjects` and `resetHighlight` are removed from `Viewer`
- `setColorFilter` ans `removeColorFilter` are removed from `Viewer` and replaced 
  by `setColorFilter`and `removeColorFilter` in `FilteringExtension`
- `setUserObjectColors` is remove from `Viewer` and replaced by `setUserObjectColors` 
  in `SelectionExtension` but usage is discouraged since paradigm no longer applies
- `resetFilters`  is removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `resetFilters` in `SelectionExtension`

### Measurements:

- `enableMeasurements` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by having a 
  `MeasurementsExtension` active and itâ€™s `enabled` accessor set
- `setMeasurementOptions` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by the `options` 
  accessor in `MeasurementsExtension`
- `removeMeasurement` removed from `Viewer` and replaced by `removeMeasurement` 
  in `MeasurementsExtension`
