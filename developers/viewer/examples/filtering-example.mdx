title: Filtering
description: All filtering functionality in the viewer is handled by the [`FilteringExtension`](/developers/viewer/extensions/filtering-extension-api).
---

In a nutshell you can:

- _Hide/show_ objects
- _Isolate/unisolate_ objects
- _Color_ objects based on properties

All functions provided by the `FilteringExtension` take object ids as a means to select objects for filtering.
Like any other extension you need to add it at initialisation time:

```typescript
const filteringExtension = viewer.createExtension(FilteringExtension);
```

## Hiding and Showing

Let's say we want to hide all the walls of a model. First thing we need to do is to find out the ids of the walls we want to hide. Depending on the model, a wall object might mean different things, but let's consider a Revit example where a wall object has the `RevitWall` speckle type.

```typescript
const wallNodes = viewer.getWorldTree().findAll((node: TreeNode) => {
  if (!node.model.raw.speckle_type) return;
  return node.model.raw.speckle_type.includes("RevitWall");
});

const filteringState = filtering.hideObjects(
  wallNodes.map((node: TreeNode) => node.model.id)
);
```

## Isolating and Unisolating

Similar to hiding, let's say we want to isolate all floors. Here's how:

```typescript
const floorNodes = viewer.getWorldTree().findAll((node: TreeNode) => {
  if (!node.model.raw.speckle_type) return;
  return node.model.raw.speckle_type.includes("RevitFloor");
});

const filteringState = filtering.isolateObjects(
  floorNodes.map((node: TreeNode) => node.model.id)
);
```

## Coloring by Properties

This filtering operation is different than the ones before as it involves the notion of `properties`. The viewer needs `PropertyInfo` objects in order to filter by color, but that's fine because there's a builtin way of getting them by using:

```typescript
const properties: PropertyInfo[] = await viewer.getObjectProperties();
```

With properties available, we can now do some color filtering!

```typescript
/** Find the 'level.name' property info*/
const propertyInfo: PropertyInfo = properties.find((value) => {
  return value.key === "level.name";
}) as PropertyInfo;

const filteringState = filtering.setColorFilter(propertyInfo);
```

Filters can be combined to a certain extent, but as a general rule of thumb, any particular object in the scene will always look how its last filter (if any) told it to look.
