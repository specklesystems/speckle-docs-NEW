Our powerful SDKs have been updated to support the next gen connectors and
data models. We will be bringing back some of your favourite examples and guides.

Example use-cases for developing with Speckle:

- Building your own applications or integrations.
- Automating tasks.
- Custom web apps and visualisations.
- Data pipelining and ETL.
- Robotics and 3D printing.
- Data analysis and machine learning.

In the meantime, you can find our older docs including the viewer API, server deployment and legacy SDKs in the [Developer Hub](https://speckle.guide/developers/).
