Data Shield is an automated data protection system that scans your Speckle models for sensitive information and creates sanitized versions for sharing. It works by identifying and removing or anonymizing confidential data while preserving the essential model structure and geometry. This ensures you can share your work confidently without compromising privacy or security.

<Note>Follow the steps in the [Getting Started](/automate/getting-started) guide to install Data Shield.</Note>

## Why Install Data Shield?

<Columns cols={3}>
<Card title="Models often contain sensitive data">
- Internal project codes
- Client contact information
- Cost estimates and pricing
- Internal notes and comments
</Card>

<Card title="Streamline Collaboration">
Instead of manually cleaning models:
- Set up once, run automatically
- Create consistent, clean versions
- Share with confidence
- Maintain original data integrity
</Card>

<Card title="Perfect for">
- Architects sharing models with clients
- Engineers collaborating with external teams
- Project managers preparing presentations
- Anyone needing to share models while protecting sensitive data
</Card>

## Shield Modes

We know one size doesn't fit all, so Data Shield offers three modes to suit your style:

### Prefix Matching
*Best for:* Simple, predictable naming conventions. Remove parameters that start with a specific prefix.
Example: Want to remove everything starting with `secret_`? Just set that prefix, and Data Shield will do the rest.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup">
    Add your prefix (like `internal_`, `private_`, or `secret_`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure">
    Toggle strict mode for case sensitivity (on or off, your call)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Pattern Matching
*Best for:* Wildcards, regex fans, and complex patterns. Get fancy and use `*`, `?`, or full regular expressions.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup">
    Add your pattern (like `*`, `?`, or `^(internal|private|confidential)_.*`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example:**
- `client_*` matches anything that starts with `client_`
- `?_internal` matches `a_internal`, `b_internal`
- `^(secret|private)_.*$/i` matches parameters starting with `secret_` or `private_`, ignoring case

### Anonymization
*Best for:* Keeping the structure and hiding the details. Automatically detect email addresses inside parameter values and anonymize them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup">
    Add your pattern (like `*`, `?`, or `^(internal|private|confidential)_.*`)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How to Use Data Shield



## Tips & Tricks
- **Test first**: Run it on a small test model before going full production.
- **Start simple**: Use prefix matching for clear conventions, pattern matching for complexity, or anonymization for safe sharing.
- **Regex pro tip**: 
  - Wrap your regex in `/` to avoid escaping characters.
  - Add `i` for case-insensitive matching.
  - Use `^` (start) and `$` (end) for tighter control.
