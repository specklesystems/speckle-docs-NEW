## Inviting members and guests
...

## Domain discoverability
If you mark your workspace as discoverable, this will notify team members using the same Speckle server that your workspace exists and that they can request to join.

- This option provides a low-friction way to allow team members to join your workspace.
- Note: For paid plans, each new member added to your workspace will be billed to your account.

## Domain protection
Enabling Domain Protection for your workspace ensures that only users with verified email domains can join your workspace.

- You can still invite external users to specific projects within your workspace.
- However, these users will not have visibility of other projects in the workspace unless explicitly invited.

## SSO
SSO is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. If your organisation already uses SSO for other applications, Speckle now supports it as well.
