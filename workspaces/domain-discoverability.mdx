### How does domain discoverability work?
Domain discoverability provides a low-friction way to allow coworkers to join your workspace.

When enabled, new Speckle users will be prompted to join your workspace if they sign up with a verified email domain defined by you. They can then **request to join** which triggers an email notification to all Admins. The request can then be accepted or rejected from the *Join requests* page under workspace settings -> People.

If you reject someone's join request, then they won't be able to request to join again. However, you can still invite them manually.

We highly encourage enabling the domain discoverability feature as it ensures more of your coworkers end up in the same workspace, instead of creating new ones, and workspace admins don't need to spend as much time sending invites. 

<Info>Domain discoverability doesn't prevent your coworkers from creating other workspaces, it only nudges joining the same one. Completely preventing other workspaces from being created is an Enterprise feature.</Info>

### How do you enable domain discoverability?
Admins can enable domain discoverability under workspace settings -> Security.

The feature works by connecting verified domains to the workspace. The email domain you used when signing up to Speckle will already be verified, so this can be added as a verified domain to your workspace in a single click (unless you signed up with a Gmail, Outlook, or another standard email provider).

If you want to connect **additional domains** to your workspace, then you first need to head to your user account's [email settings](https://app.speckle.systems/settings/user/emails) to verify more emails with Speckle. Any emails you verify here will show up as verified domains you can connect to your workspace in the domain discoverability settings.

### Joining Without Admin Approval
When a user discovers your workspace, you can decide if they should **request to join**, followed by an admin approval flow, or if they should be allowed to **join immediately without admin approval**. You can opt in to the latter from the same place you enable the domain discoverability feature.

<Warning>
  Joining without admin approval should be used with caution. Suitable for **enterprise** and **academia** plans 
  else you would be at risk of an uncontrolled escalation of your billing.
</Warning>
