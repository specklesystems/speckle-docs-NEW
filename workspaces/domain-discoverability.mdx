### How does domain discoverability work?
Domain discoverability provides a low-friction way to allow coworkers to join your workspace.

When enabled, new Speckle users signing up with your verified email domains will be prompted to join your workspace. They can **request to join**, which triggers an email notification to all Admins. Request can then be accepted or rejected from the *Join requests* page under Workspace Settings -> People.

If you reject someone's join request, they won't be able to request to join again. However, you can still invite them manually.

We recommend enabling domain discoverability to help more of your coworkers end up in the same workspace instead of creating separate ones. This also reduces the need for manual invites.

<Info>Domain discoverability doesn't prevent your coworkers from creating other workspaces. It only encourages joining the same one. Completely preventing other workspaces from being created is an Enterprise feature.</Info>

### How do you enable domain discoverability?
Admins can enable domain discoverability under Workspace Settings -> Security.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect verified domains to workspace">
    Domain discoverability works by connecting one or more verified domains to the workspace. Add these from the top of the Security settings page.
    
    The email domain you used when signing up to Speckle will already be verified, so you can add it as a verified domain to your workspace with a single click (unless you signed up with Gmail, Outlook, or another standard email provider).

    To connect additional domains to your workspace, first verify more emails in your [email settings](https://app.speckle.systems/settings/user/emails). Any emails you verify there will show up as available domains you can connect to your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable domain discoverability">
    Enable domain discoverability with the toggle switch on the Security settings page.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Joining without admin approval
When a user discovers your workspace, you can decide if they should **request to join** (followed by admin approval), or **join immediately without admin approval**. You can enable instant joining from the same place you enable domain discoverability.

<Warning>
  Joining without admin approval should be used with caution. Suitable for **Enterprise** and **Academia** plans else you would be at risk of an uncontrolled escalation of your billing.
</Warning>
