## Choose a plan

Blablabla. Explore pricing and compare plans on speckle.systems/pricing.

## Paid vs. free seats
In a workspace you only pay for users on an Editor seat. Users on a Viewer seat are always free. Learn more about seat types.

## Subscriptions

All billing and subscription options are managed directly in the Workspace under Settings > Billing.

Key points:

- Subscription costs adjust dynamically as you add and remove members.
- When a user on an Editor seat leaves the workspace, their seat remains billed until the next billing cycle begins. The seat can be assigned to another user in the workspace.
- Plans and pricing details are displayed directly in the in-app billing section.
- Billing supports both monthly and annual payment options

## Managing billing

You can manage your Workspace subscription directly from the in-app billing interface. Available operations include:

- Upgrading plans: Easily switch to higher-tier plans as your needs evolve.

- Downgrading plans: Not yet supported in-app; contact Speckle Support to downgrade.

- Inviting people:

Adding new users to a workspace is free because everyone joins on the free Viewer seat.
Assigning someone an Editor seat immediately increases the subscription cost by one seat (if no unoccupied Editor seats are available).
Removing people:

Removing an Editor seat from soneone does not immediately lower the subscription cost.
The Editor seat count will be adjusted at the start of the next billing cycle, unless the Editor seat has been assigned to someone else in the meantime.
Cancelling a Subscription: Cancel your subscription to stop future charges. Workspaces will enter read-only mode after the current billing cycle ends, but all data remains intact.
