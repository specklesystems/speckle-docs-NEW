<Note>Workspaces come in three plans: **Free**, **Starter**, and **Business**. View pricing and find the plan that matches your needs on [speckle.systems/pricing](https://www.speckle.systems/pricing). Speckle is free without limits for academia.</Note>

## Subscribe to a Plan
Upgrade your workspace to one of the paid plans under Settings -> Billing.

- We support both monthly and annual payment options.
- Charges happen towards a payment card that you connect to your active subscription.
- Paying via invoice is reserved for contracts above a certain usage limit and only for annual subscriptions. Contact us if you are interested in this.

## Paid Versus Free Seats
You pay for users who are assigned an Editor seat. Users on Viewer seats are always free. Learn about the difference [here](/workspaces/roles-and-seats#seats).

## Buy and Remove Seats
Subscription costs adjust dynamically as `Admins` assign and remove Editor seats from workspace users. You can buy, assign, and remove seats under Settings -> People. 

- **Buy Editor seats:** If you want to buy an Editor seat, go to the user who needs the seat under Settings -> People and upgrade their seat from Viewer to Editor. This will immediately increase the subscription cost by one seat unless an unused Editor seat was available.

- **Remove Editor seats**: Removing an Editor seat from a workspace user does not immediately lower the subscription cost. The Editor seat remains billed and available until the next billing cycle begins.

- **When someone leaves a workspace:** When a user on an Editor seat leaves your workspace, their Editor seat remains billed and available until the next billing cycle begins.

- **Billable seats are automatically adjusted:** The number of Editor seats you are billed for is automatically adjusted when a new billing cycle starts. Example: You pay for 5 Editors seats and remove an Editor seat from a user without reassigning it to someone else. -> Your subscription will be downgraded to 4 Editor seats when the next billing cycle starts. 


## Change Your Subscription

You can make changes to your subscription under Settings -> Billing.

- **Change billing cycle:** Change from a monthly to yearly billing cycle to save 10% on your subscription costs. It's not yet possible to change from a yearly to a monthly billing cycle without cancelling your subscribtion and resubscribing.

- **Get unlimited projects and models:** You can add the *Unlimited projects and models* add-on to your Starter or Business plan to remove those usage limits.

- **Upgrade plan:** Easily switch to a higher-tier plan as your needs evolve.

- **Downgrade plan:** This is not yet supported via the app so please contact us if you wish to downgrade to a lower-tier plan.

- **Cancel plan:** You can cancel your subscription to stop future charges. The subscription will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. When cancelled, your data will remain intact and available, but the workspace is in a read-only mode.
