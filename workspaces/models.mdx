## What are Models?

**Models** help you organise your data within a project. They’re useful for separating different parts of your work — like design options, disciplines, or team responsibilities.

Every project starts with one default model (often called **main**).  
You can keep everything in that model, or create additional ones to:

- Explore different design options in parallel  
- Separate work by team or discipline  
- Organise project components more clearly

Models give you the flexibility to structure your data in a way that fits how you work.


## How Do I Use Models?

You can create as many models as you need within a single project.  
The Speckle Web App makes it easy to add new models and switch between them.

### Why use multiple models?

Here are a few common examples:

- **Split by discipline**: For large projects, you might separate models by team — for example: **Architecture**, **Structural**, and **MEP**. This way, each team only receives what’s relevant to them.

- **Split by building**: If your project includes multiple buildings on the same site, you can keep everything in one project but create separate models like **Building A**, **Building B**, and **Building C**.

- **Explore design options**: Want to present different façade concepts? Create models like **Option A**, **Option B**, and **Option C**, and switch between them to show your client.

### Federate Models

In Speckle, you can **federate models** by loading multiple models into the same view — even if they were created separately.

This is useful when working with different teams or disciplines. For example, you can view the **architecture**, **structure**, and **MEP** models together in a single, coordinated view without merging them into one file.

Federating models helps you:
- Compare different design options
- Coordinate between disciplines
- Keep models separate while still viewing them side-by-side

You can do this directly in the **Speckle Web Viewer**, or within supported design tools using our Connectors.
