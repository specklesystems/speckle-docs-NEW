**Models** help you organise your data within a project. They're useful for splitting 
different parts of your work, such as design options, disciplines, or team responsibilities.

## Creating models

A new project starts without models present. You can create an empty model in the web interface or
from a connector. This is simply a container for your data; it will have data in it 
once you publish data from a supported design tool using a connector.

You can keep everything in that model or create additional ones to explore design options, 
separate work by team or discipline, and organise project components more clearly.

Models give you the flexibility to structure your data to fit how you work.

## Managing models

You can create as many models as you need within a project within your workspace limits.
The Speckle Web App makes it simple to add new models and switch between them.

Models can be named to mimic a folder structure by using a forward slash `/` in the name, 
e.g. `Building A/Floors/Floor 1`.

import Models from '/snippets/faqs/models.mdx'
