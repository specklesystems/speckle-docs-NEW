Data residency is about making sure your data stays in a specific geographic location to meet local laws and regulations. If your organization needs to comply with rules like GDPR in Europe or data sovereignty requirements in other regions, this is something you'll want to understand.

## Why data residency matters

Some organizations need to keep their data in specific locations to stay compliant with local laws. For example:
- GDPR requires that EU citizens' personal data is protected according to European standards, no matter where it's stored or processed.
- Some government organizations in countries like Australia must keep certain data within their borders.

By choosing where your data is stored, you can meet these requirements and show that you're staying compliant.

## How data residency works in Speckle

Speckle workspaces let you choose where your data lives, so you can stay compliant while keeping full control over your data.

- Every workspace starts in Speckle's default region.
- Business plan customers can choose a different region for their workspace to meet their compliance needs.
- The **Extra data region** add-on lets you set data residency at the project level for more granular control.

## Available regions

Data residency is available on the Business plan.

- Choose from EU, UK, North America, or Asia Pacific as your workspace's default region. All of your project data will be stored in this region.
- For more granular regions, and project-specific regions, <a href="mailto:billing@speckle.systems">contact us</a> about the **Extra data region add-on**.
- If you don't specify a region, your data automatically goes to one of Speckle's default regions, optimized for performance and speed.
