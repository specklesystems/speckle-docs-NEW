<Note>Data residency is available on the Business plan.</Note>

Data residency means storing your data in a specific geographic location to meet local laws and regulations.

## Why data residency matters

Different regions have different requirements for where data can be stored:

- GDPR requires that EU citizens' personal data is protected according to European standards, no matter where it's stored or processed.
- Some government organizations in countries like Australia must keep certain data within their borders.

By choosing where your data is stored, you can meet these requirements and demonstrate compliance.

## How data residency works in Speckle

Speckle workspaces let you choose where your data lives, so you can stay compliant while keeping full control over your data.

- Every workspace starts in Speckle's default region.
- Business plan customers can choose a different region for their workspace to meet their compliance needs.
- The **Extra data region** add-on lets you set data residency at the project level for more granular control.

## Available regions

Data residency is available on the Business plan.

- Choose from **EU**, **UK**, **North America**, or **Asia Pacific** as your workspace's default region. All of your project data will be stored in this region.
- For more granular regions, and project-specific regions, <a href="mailto:billing@speckle.systems">contact us</a> about the **Extra data region add-on**.
- If you don't specify a region, your data automatically goes to one of Speckle's default regions, optimized for performance and speed.
