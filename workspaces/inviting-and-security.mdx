This doc contains information about how to invite users to a workspace, how to make it easy for others to join, and how to make a workspace secure with domain protection and SSO.

## How to invite people to a workspace

Admins can invite new users to a workspace under Workspace settings -> People.

When inviting, you need to decide if someone should join the workspace as a Member or a Guest. The Member role is meant for coworkers, while the Guest role is meant for external collaborators. You can learn more about Members and Guests [here](/workspaces/roles-and-seats#workspace-roles).

By default, new users are assigned the free Viewer seat when they are invited to a workspace. This means they won't be able to contribute to projects as an editor until an Admin has upgraded their seat to an Editor seat. You can learn about seats [here](/workspaces/roles-and-seats#seats).

### Bulk inviting

There's a hidden—but smart—feature in the invite modal if you need to invite a lot of users at the same time.

1. Copy a list of emails to your clipboard. The emails can be separated by spaces, commas or semicolons.
2. Paste the emails into the first email input in the invite modal.
3. The emails will now be pasted into individual inputs for easy sending.

### Inviting someone to a single project

If you want someone to have access to just a single project in your workspace—or a select few—then you can invite them to your workspace as a Guest. This role is typically reserved for external collaborators, and it ensures that someone have access to the exact projects you grant them access to. You can learn more about Guests [here](/workspaces/roles-and-seats#workspace-roles).

To send a project invite, navigate directly to the project and send the invite from the Collaborators tab. People invited from here *always* join the workspace as Guests. If you later want a person to become a full workspace Member then you can update their workspace role from Settings -> People. 

## Domain discoverability: Make it easy for your coworkers to join

Domain discoverability provides a low-friction way to allow coworkers to join your workspace.

When enabled, new Speckle users will be prompted to join your workspace if they sign up with a verified email domain defined by you. They can then **request to join** which triggers an email notification to all Admins. The request can then be accepted or rejected from the *Join requests* page under workspace settings -> People.

If you reject someone's join request, then they won't be able to request to join again. However, you can still invite them manually.

We highly encourage enabling the domain discoverability feature as it ensures more of your coworkers end up in the same workspace, instead of creating new ones, and workspace admins don't need to spend as much time sending invites. 

<Info>Domain discoverability doesn't prevent your coworkers from creating other workspaces, it only nudges joining the same one. Completely preventing other workspaces from being created is an Enterprise feature.</Info>

### How to enable domain discoverability
Admins can enable domain discoverability under workspace settings -> Security.

The feature works by connecting verified domains to the workspace. The email domain you used when signing up to Speckle will already be verified, so this can be added as a verified domain to your workspace in a single click (unless you signed up with a Gmail, Outlook, or another standard email provider).

If you want to connect **additional domains** to your workspace, then you first need to head to your user account's [email settings](https://app.speckle.systems/settings/user/emails) to verify more emails with Speckle. Any emails you verify here will show up as verified domains you can connect to your workspace in the domain discoverability settings.

### Let users join without admin approval
When a user discovers your workspace, you can decide if they should **request to join**, followed by an admin approval flow, or if they should be allowed to **join immediately without admin approval**. You can opt in to the latter from the same place you enable the domain discoverability feature.

## Domain protection
(WIP)

Enabling domain protection ensures that only users with verified email domains you define can join your workspace. Invites cannot 

Note that . This is because the Guest role is intended for external collaborators who usually don't have an email with your organization's.

<Info>
  If your organization is using SSO then you don't need to also enable domain protection.

<Note>
  Domain protection is available on the Business plan.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)
(WIP)

SSO is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials.

Admins can enable SSO under Settings -\> Security and the page contains. We are more than happy to jump on a quick call with you if you need help with this process.

When SSO is enabled,
