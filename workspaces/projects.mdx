## Projects
#### What are Projects?

In Speckle, a **Project** is where your data lives.

Think of a project as a container that helps you organise, manage, and share your work. You can give each project a name and description to help you keep things clear and easy to find.

Projects also let you **collaborate** with others. You can share a project with your team and control who can view or edit it.

#### What can a Project contain?

A project can hold anything—from a few objects to an entire building model. You can create as many projects as you like and add as much (or as little) data as you need.

Some examples of what a project might include:
- A layer from a CAD application  
- A furniture (Revit family)  
- A workset or selection from Revit  
- A group of objects from Grasshopper  
- A structural model  
- Calculation results  

Projects also support **models** and **versions** to help you manage changes and updates.  
We’ll explain how those work in the next sections—no need to worry about them just yet!
