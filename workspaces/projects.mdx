## What are projects?

In Speckle, a **project** is where your data lives.

Think of a project as a container that helps you organise, manage, and share your work. You can give each project a name and description to help you keep things clear and easy to find.

Projects also let you **collaborate** with others. You can share a project with your team and control who can view or edit it.

## What can a project contain?

A project can hold anythingâ€”from a few objects to an entire building model. You can create as many projects as you like and add as much (or as little) data as you need.

Some examples of what a project might include:

- A layer from a CAD application
- A furniture (Revit family)
- A workset or selection from Revit
- A group of objects from Grasshopper
- A structural model
- Calculation results

Projects are containers for **models** and **versions**, no project design data lives outside of a model version. 
We'll explain how those work in the next sections. Only the name and description and 
the members of a project exist outside of a model version.

## Who can I share projects with?

While a workspace can have **members** and **guests** that can impact who can have access to the 
projects within it, projects themselves can be shared with specific users to control access and 
within the security settings of the workspace.

### Access Control

A project can have a global state of:
- **Public**: Anyone with the link can view,  
- **Workspace**: All workspace members can view, but not guests, or
- **Private**: Only for project members and admins.

### Discussions

The ability to contribute to discussions is controlled at the project level:
- **Anyone**: Anyone can contribute to discussions with comments and replies if they have access to the project and have a Speckle account.
- **Collaborators**: Only project collaborators can contribute to discussions.

Learn more about discussions in the [discussions](/3d-viewer/discussions) page.

### Personal Access

You can choose to leave a project at any time. This will remove your access to the project and 
you will no longer be able to view or contribute to it.

<Note>If you are an admin of the workspace, you will not be able to leave a project 
if there are no other admins left.</Note>
