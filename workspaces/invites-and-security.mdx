## How to invite people to a workspace

Admins can invite new users to a workspace. This can be done from a couple of places:

- From people settings under Settings -> People.
- By clicking "Invite your team"
- From project pages under the Collaborators tab.

Whenever you

Viewer seats.

### Inviting someone to a single project

If you want a user to have access to just a single project in your workspace – or a select few – then you can invite them as a Guest. You can do this in two ways:

1. Select that you are inviting "An external collaborator"
2. Or, send your invite directly from the project page of the project you want to. Invites sent from project pages are *always* sent as Guest invites.

If you send a workspace invite from a project page then the invitation is always of the Guest type. If you did this by mistake  

Speckle users usually use this Guest role to invite external collaborators into their workspace.

You can read more about the difference between Guests and Members [here](/workspaces/roles-and-seats).


## Domain discoverability: Make it easy for your team to join

Domain discoverability provides a low-friction way to allow team members to join your workspace.

If you mark your workspace as discoverable, this will notify team members using the same Speckle server that your workspace exists and that they can request to join.

### Let users join without admin approval

By default, admins 

If you have this setting set to **Admin approval**, every time a new user joins Loom and requests to join your Workspace, you'll receive an email requesting that access. If it's set to **Instant access,** the users will immediately have access.

## Domain protection

Enabling domain protection ensures that only users with verified email domains can join your workspace.

You can still invite external users as Guests to specific projects within your workspace. However, these users will not have visibility of other projects in the workspace unless explicitly invited.

Domain protection is available on the Business plan.

## SSO

SSO is a user authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications with one set of login credentials. If your organisation already uses SSO for other applications, Speckle now supports it as well.

SSO is available on the Business plan.
