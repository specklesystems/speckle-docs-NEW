title: Version Control
description: "Keep track of every model"
---

Every time new data is published to a **model**, a new **version** is created. 
This is a snapshot of your model at a specific point in time, a moment in your project's history. 
Versions are store forever or until you delete a model for which they were created.

Versions help you keep track of changes, they record who published them, form which source 
updated what and when, by default eveyone always sees the latest version with the flexibility
to go back to a previous state if needed.

Each version includes:
- All the objects in your model  
- The date and time it was created  
- The person who published it  
- (Optional) A short message describing what changed

This makes collaboration easier, keeps your work organized, and ensures nothing gets lost along the way.

## How do I use versions?

If you've sent data through a **connector**, you've already used versions, they're 
created automatically each time you publish to a project.

Once you've published a new version, to keep things clear you can add a **version message**:
a short note that explains what the version includes. This is optional, some connectors 
will suggest a default message for you, but you can decide when a versions should have a special status.

### Receiving Version Data
When **receiving data**, you can choose to:
- Stay synced with the **latest version**, or  
- Load a **specific version** using its version ID

If you're synced with the latest version, you'll get a notification when someone 
sends new data to the project. You can then click **Receive** to bring in the latest 
updates and keep your file current.

### Accessing and Editing a Version

You can view and manage all versions of your model directly from your project space.

There are two main actions you can take on a version:

- **Edit the version message**
- **Delete the version**

To do this:

1. Click the three dots next to the model.
2. Select **View versions**.
3. Find the version you want to update and click the three dots in the top-right corner.
4. Choose **Edit message** or **Delete version**.

### Latest Version
The latest version is always the default, but you can delete that version which will 
promote the immediately previous version to be the latest. Alternatively you can simply 
publish a new version which will become the latest.

### Comparing Versions
Because all versions are kept and cannot be changed once published you can compare 
two versions to see the differences between them. This is useful to review changes, 
or to see what changed between two specific points in time. More info about [Comparing Versions](/3d-viewer/compare-versions).
