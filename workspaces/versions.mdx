## What are Versions?

A **version** is a snapshot of your model at a specific point in time — like saving a moment in your project’s history.  
Each time you **publish** your data to Speckle, a new version is automatically created.

Versions help you keep track of changes, see who updated what and when, and even go back to a previous state if needed.  
It’s like having a timeline of your project that you can review or restore at any time.

Each version includes:
- All the objects in your model  
- The date and time it was created  
- The person who published it  
- (Optional) A short message describing what changed

This makes collaboration easier, keeps your work organized, and ensures nothing gets lost along the way.

## How Do I Use Versions?

If you’ve sent data through a Connector, you’ve already used versions — they’re created automatically each time you publish to a project.

To keep things clear, you can add a **version message** — a short note that explains what the version includes. Some Connectors will suggest a default message for you, but you can always write your own.

When **receiving data**, you can choose to:
- Stay synced with the **latest version**, or  
- Load a **specific version** using its version ID

If you’re synced with the latest version, you’ll get a notification when someone sends new data to the project. You can then click **Receive** to bring in the latest updates and keep your file current.
