### What is workspace discoverability?
You can make your workspace discoverable to provide a low-friction way to allow coworkers to join your workspace.

When enabled, new Speckle users signing up with your verified email domains will be prompted to join your workspace. They can **request to join**, which triggers an email notification to all Admins. The request can then be accepted or rejected from the *Join requests* page under Workspace Settings -> People.

If you reject someone's join request, they won't be able to request to join again. However, you can still invite them manually.

We recommend enabling the feature to make sure your coworkers end up in the same workspace instead of creating separate ones. This also reduces the need for manual invites.

<Info>Workspace discoverability doesn't prevent your coworkers from creating other workspaces. It only encourages joining the same one. Completely preventing other workspaces from being created is an Enterprise feature.</Info>

### How do you make a workspace discoverable?
Admins can enable workspace discoverability under Workspace Settings -> Security.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect verified domains to workspace">
    Workspace discoverability works by connecting one or more verified domains to the workspace. You can verify a domain from the top of the Security settings page.
    
    The email domain you used when signing up to Speckle will already be verified, so you can add it as a verified domain to your workspace with a single click (unless you signed up with Gmail, Outlook, or another standard email provider).

    To connect additional domains to your workspace, first verify more emails in your [email settings](https://app.speckle.systems/settings/user/emails). Any emails you verify there will show up as available domains you can connect to your workspace.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable workspace discoverability">
    Enable workspace discoverability with the toggle switch on the Security settings page.
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Joining without admin approval
When a user discovers your workspace, you can decide if they should **request to join** (followed by admin approval), or **join immediately without admin approval**. You can enable instant joining from the same place you enable workspace discoverability.

<Warning>
  Joining without admin approval should be used with caution. Suitable for **Enterprise** and **Academia** plans else you would be at risk of an uncontrolled escalation of your billing.
</Warning>
