### How to invite to your workspace?
Admins can invite new users to a workspace under Workspace settings -> People.

When inviting, you need to decide if someone should join the workspace as a Member or a Guest. The Member role is meant for coworkers, while the Guest role is meant for external collaborators. You can learn more about Members and Guests [here](/workspaces/roles-and-seats#workspace-roles).

By default, new users are assigned the free Viewer seat when they are invited to a workspace. This means they won't be able to contribute to projects as an editor until an Admin has upgraded their seat to an Editor seat. You can learn about seats [here](/workspaces/roles-and-seats#seats).

### Bulk Inviting

There's a hidden—but smart—feature in the invite modal if you need to invite a lot of users at the same time.

1. Copy a list of emails to your clipboard. The emails can be separated by spaces, commas or semicolons.
2. Paste the emails into the first email input in the invite modal.
3. The emails will now be pasted into individual inputs for easy sending.

### Inviting to a Single Project

If you want someone to have access to just a single project in your workspace—or a select few—then you can invite them to your workspace as a Guest. This role is typically reserved for external collaborators, and it ensures that someone have access to the exact projects you grant them access to. You can learn more about Guests [here](/workspaces/roles-and-seats#workspace-roles).

To send a project invite, navigate directly to the project and send the invite from the Collaborators tab. People invited from here *always* join the workspace as Guests. If you later want a person to become a full workspace Member then you can update their workspace role from Settings -> People.
