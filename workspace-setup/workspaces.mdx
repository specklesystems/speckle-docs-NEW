## What is a Workspace?

A Workspace provides a secure, centralised environment for your team to collaborate, manage projects, and control access to shared data.

## Key Features of Workspaces

Workspaces are designed to:

- Enable granular access control for projects and team members.
- Provide domain-based membership protection for enhanced security.
- Support team collaboration with centralised project and user management.
- Streamline project workflows and data sharing.
- Allow for collaboration and team development of automations with Speckle Automate.
- Explore the Starter or Business plans for increased usaged limits and advanced functionality like Single Sign-On (SSO) or custom data residency.

## Managing Access and Permissions

### Verified Domains
To customise your workspace and make it visible to your entire team, you can verify an email domain associated with your account:

1. Select your workspace from the sidebar.
2. Go to the Settings tab.
3. Add a new domain. This will include all email domains youâ€™ve verified for your account.

### Workspace protection
Enabling Domain Protection for your workspace ensures that only users with verified email domains can join your workspace.

- You can still invite external users to specific projects within your workspace.
- However, these users will not have visibility of other projects in the workspace unless explicitly invited.

### Workspace Discoverability
If you mark your workspace as discoverable, this will notify team members using the same Speckle server that your workspace exists and that they can request to join.

- This option provides a low-friction way to allow team members to join your workspace.
- Note: For paid plans, each new member added to your workspace will be billed to your account.
